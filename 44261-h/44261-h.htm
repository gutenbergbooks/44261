<h2><a name="TRANSLATORS_PREFACE" id="TRANSLATORS_PREFACE">TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</a></h2>
<p>Conquerors are deemed successful robbers,
    while robbers are unsuccessful
    conquerors. If the founder of the dynasty
    of the Ming had failed in his
    rebellion against the Moguls, history
    would have called him a robber; and if
    any one of the various robber-chiefs, who
    in the course of the two last centuries
    made war against the reigning Manchow,
    had overthrown the government of the
    foreigners, the official historiographers of
    the &quot;<i>Middle empire</i>&quot; would have called
    him <i>the far-famed, illustrious elder father</i> of the new dynasty.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>
<p>Robbers or pirates are usually ignorant
    of the principles concerning human society.
    They are not aware that power is
    derived from the people for the general
    advantage, and that when it is abused to
    a certain extent, all means of redress resorted
    to are legitimate. But they feel
    most violently the abuse of power. The
    fruit of labour is too often taken out of
    their hands, justice sold for money, and
    nothing is safe from their rapacious and
    luxurious masters. People arise to oppose,
    and act according to the philosophical
    principles of human society, without having
    any clear idea about them. Robbers
    and pirates are, in fact, the opposition
    party in the despotical empires of the
    East; and their history is far more interesting
    than that of the reigning despot.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> The sameness which is to be observed in
    the history of all Asiatic governments,
    presents a great difficulty to any historian
    who wishes to write a history of any nation
    in Asia for the general reader.</p>
<p>The history of the transactions between
    Europeans and the Chinese is intimately
    connected with that of the pirate chiefs
    who appeared from time to time in the
    Chinese Sea, or Southern Ocean. The
    Europeans themselves, at their first appearance
    in the <i>middle empire</i>, only became
    known as pirates. Simon de Andrada,
    the first Portuguese who (1521)
    tried to establish any regular trade with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> China, committed violence against the
    merchants, and bought young Chinese to
    use them as slaves; and it is known that
    it was the policy of the <i>civilized foreigners</i> from the &quot;Great Western Ocean&quot; (which
    is the Chinese name for Europe) to decry
    their competitors in trade as pirates and
    outlaws.</p>
<p>The footing which Europeans and Americans
    now enjoy in China, originated from
    the assistance given by the Portuguese to
    the Manchow against the Patriots, otherwise
    called pirates, who would not submit
    to the sway of foreigners. Macao,
    the only residence (or large prison) in
    which foreigners are shut up, is not considered
    by the Chinese Government as
    belonging exclusively to the Portuguese.
    The Dutch, on not being allowed to remain
    in Macao, complained to the Chinese
    Government, and the authorities of
    the middle empire commanded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> Portuguese to grant houses to the newly
    arrived <i>Holan</i> or Hollander, &quot;since Macao
    was to be considered as the abode of <i>all</i> foreigners trading with China.&quot; The
    edicts concerning this transaction are
    stated to be now in the archives of the
    Dutch factory at Macao.</p>
<p>It is one of the most interesting facts in
    the history of the Chinese empire, that
    the various barbarous tribes, who subdued
    either the whole or a part of this singular
    country, were themselves ultimately subdued
    by the peculiar civilization of their
    subjects. The Kitans, Moguls, and Manchow,
    became, in the course of time,
    Chinese people; like the Ostro, and Visigoths,
    and Longobards&mdash;Romans. But
    we may remark, that both the Chinese
    and the Roman civilization under the
    Emperors recommended itself to the conquerors,
    as connected with a despotism
    which particularly suited the views of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> conquerors. Though this large division
    of the human race, which we are accustomed
    to call <i>Tatars</i>, never felt a spark
    of that liberty which everywhere animated
    the various German nations and tribes, and
    the Khakhans, in consequence of this, were
    not in need of any foreign policy to enslave
    their compatriots; yet it may be
    said, that neither Moguls nor Manchow
    were able to establish a despotic form of
    government which worked so well for a
    large nation as that of the Chinese.</p>
<p>The extremes of both despotism and
    democracy acknowledge no intermediary
    power or rank. The sovereign is the
    vice-regent of heaven, and all in all;
    he is the only rule of right and wrong,
    and commands both what shall be done in
    this world and thought of concerning the
    next. It may be easily imagined, that the
    Jesuits, on their first arrival in China,
    were delighted with such a perfect specimen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> of government according to their
    political sentiments. They tried all that
    human power could command to succeed
    in the conversion of this worldly paradise.
    The fathers disguised themselves as astronomers,
    watchmakers, painters, musicians,
    and engineers.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> They forged inscriptions<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and invented miracles, and almost went to
    the extent of canonizing Confucius. But
    this cunning deference to Chinese customs
    involved the Jesuits in a dispute
    with their more pious but less prudent
    competitors; and notwithstanding all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> cleverness of the Jesuits, the Chinese
    saw at last, that in becoming Roman Catholic
    Christians they must cease to be
    Chinese, and obey a foreign sovereign in
    the <i>Great Western Ocean</i>. Toland affirms,
    that the Chinese and the Irish, in the time
    of their heathen monarch Laogirius, were
    the only nations in which religious persecutions
    never existed;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> this praise now
    refers exclusively to Ireland. Roman
    Catholicism is at this moment nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> extinguished in China. To become a
    Christian is considered high-treason, and
    the only Roman Catholic priest at Canton
    at the present time, is compelled to hide
    himself under the mask of shopkeeper.
    In their successful times, during the seventeenth
    century, the Roman Catholic Missionaries
    published in Europe, that no
    nation was more virtuous, nor any government
    more enlightened than that of
    the Chinese; these false eulogies were
    the source of that high opinion in which
    the Chinese were formerly held in Europe.</p>
<p>The merchants and adventurers who
    came to China &quot;to make money&quot; found
    both the government and people widely
    different from descriptions given by the
    Jesuits. They found that the Chinese officers
    of government, commonly called
    Mandarins, would think themselves defiled
    by the least intercourse with foreigners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> particularly merchants; and that
    the laws are often interpreted quite differently
    before and after receiving bribes.
    The Europeans were proud of their civilization
    and cleverness in mercantile
    transactions, and considered the inhabitants
    of all the other parts of the world
    as barbarians; but they found, to their
    astonishment and disappointment, the
    Chinese still more proud and cunning.
    We may easily presume that these deluded
    merchants became very irritated,
    and in their anger they reported to their
    countrymen in Europe that the Chinese
    were the most treacherous and abandoned
    people in the world,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that &quot;they were
    only a peculiar race of savages,&quot; and required
    to be chastised in one way or
    another; which would certainly be very
    easy. Commodore Anson, with a single
    weather-beaten sixty-gun ship, in fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> set the whole power of the Chinese Government
    at defiance.</p>
<p>The Translator of the History of the
    Pirates ventures to affirm, that the Chinese
    system of government is by far the
    best that ever existed in Asia; not excepting
    any of the different monarchies
    founded by the followers of Alexander,
    the government of the Roman PrÃ¦tors
    and of Byzantine Dukes, or that of
    Christian Kings and Barons who reigned
    in various parts of the East during the
    middle ages. The principles of Chinese
    government are those of virtue and justice;
    but they are greatly corrupted by
    the passions and vices of men. The
    greater part of their laws are good and
    just, though the practice is often bad; but
    unfortunately this is generally not known
    to the &quot;Son of Heaven.&quot; It is the interest
    of the Emperor to deal out justice to the
    lowest of his subjects; but, supposing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span> were possible that one man could manage
    the government of such an immense empire,
    who either could or would dare to
    denounce every vicious or unjust act of
    the officers employed by government?
    The Chinese themselves are a clever
    shrewd sort of people; deceit and falsehood
    are, perhaps, more generally found
    in the &quot;flowery empire&quot; than any where
    else; but take them all in all, they rank
    high in the scale of nations, and the
    generality of the people seem to be quite
    satisfied with their government; they
    may wish for a change of masters, but
    certainly not for an entire change of the
    system of government.</p>
<p>There has existed for a long period,
    and still exists, a powerful party in the
    Chinese Empire, which is against the dominion
    of the Manchow; the different
    mountainous tribes maintain, even now,
    in the interior of China, a certain independence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> of the Tay tsing dynasty. The
    Meao tsze, who were in Canton some
    years ago, stated, with a proud feeling,
    that they were <i>Ming jin</i>, people of Ming;
    the title of the native sovereigns of China
    before the conquest of the Manchow. It
    is said, that the whole disaffected party is
    united in a society&mdash;generally called the <i>Triade-Union</i>&mdash;and that they aimed at
    the overthrow of the Tatars, particularly
    under the weak government of the late
    Emperor; but the rebels totally failed in
    their object both by sea and land.</p>
<p>It has been falsely reported in Europe,
    that it is not allowed by the laws of
    China to publish the transactions of the
    reigning dynasty. It is true that the history
    written by the official or imperial
    historians is not published; but there
    is no statute which prohibits other persons
    from writing the occurrences of their
    times. It may be easily imagined that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> such authors will take especial care not to
    state any thing which may be offensive to
    persons in power. There is, however, no
    official court in China to regulate the
    course of the human understanding, there
    is nothing like that tribunal which in the
    greater part of the Continent of Europe
    is called the <i>Censorship</i>. Fear alone is
    quite sufficient to check the rising spirits
    of the liberals in the middle empire. The
    reader, therefore, should not expect that
    either the author of the &quot;History of the
    Rebellions in the Interior of China,&quot; or
    the writer of the &quot;Pacification of the Pirates,&quot;
    would presume to state that persons
    whom government is pleased to style
    robbers and pirates, are in reality enemies
    of the present dynasty; neither
    would they state that government, not
    being able to quell these rebellions, are
    compelled to give large recompenses to
    the different chiefs who submit. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span> facts are scarcely hinted at in the Chinese
    histories. The government officers are
    usually delineated as the most excellent
    men in the world. When they run away,
    they know before-hand that fighting will
    avail nothing; and when they pardon,
    they are not said to be compelled by necessity,
    but it is described as an act of
    heavenly virtue! From what we learn by
    the statements of a Chinese executioner,
    we should be led to form a bad opinion of
    the veracity of these historians, and the
    heavenly virtue of their government; for
    it is said, that one Chinese executioner beheaded
    a thousand pirates in one year.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>
<p>The author of the following work is
    a certain <i>Yung lun yuen</i>, called <i>Jang
    sÃ«en</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> a native of the city or market
    town <i>Shun tih</i>, eighty le southerly from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span> Canton. The great number of proper
    names, of persons and places, to be
    found in the &quot;<i>History of the Pacification
    of the Pirates</i>,&quot; together with the nicknames
    and thieves' slang employed by
    the followers of Ching y&#301;h, presented peculiar
    difficulties in the translation of <i>Yuen's</i> publication. The work was published
    in November 1830 at Canton; and
    it is to be regretted, for the fame of the
    author in the <i>Great Western Ocean</i>, that he
    used provincial and abbreviated characters.
    I will not complain that by so
    doing he caused many difficulties to his
    translator, for a native of <i>Shun tih</i> would
    not trouble himself on that point; but I
    have reason to believe that the head
    schoolmaster of Kwang tung will think
    it an abomination that Yung lun yuen
    should dare take such liberties in a historical
    composition. Schoolmasters have
    a greater sway in China than any where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span> else, and they like not to be trifled with.
    These are particularly the men, who,
    above all others, oppose any innovation
    or reform; scholars, who presume to
    know every thing between heaven and
    earth: and they may certainly satisfy every
    man, who will rest satisfied by mere
    words. These learned gentlemen are too
    much occupied with their own philosophical
    and literary disquisitions, to have any
    time, or to think it worth their notice, to
    pay attention to surrounding empires or
    nations. If we consider the scanty and
    foolish notices which are found in recent
    Chinese publications regarding those nations
    with which the Chinese should be
    well acquainted, we cannot but form a
    very low estimate of the present state of
    Chinese literature. How far otherwise
    are the accounts of foreign nations, which
    are to be found in the great work of
    Matuanlin! It will, perhaps, be interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span> to the European reader to learn, what
    the Chinese know and report concerning
    the nations of <i>Ta se yang</i>, or the <i>Great
    Western Ocean</i>. I therefore take an opportunity
    here to give some extracts from a
    Chinese publication relative to European
    nations, printed last year at Canton.</p>
<p>The <i>fifty-seventh book</i> of the <i>Memoirs
    concerning the South of the Mei ling Mountains</i>,
    contains a history of all the Southern
    barbarians (or foreigners); and here
    are mentioned&mdash;with the <i>Tanka</i> people
    and other barbarous tribes of Kwang
    tung and Kwang se&mdash;the <i>Siamese</i>, the <i>Mahometans</i>, the <i>French</i>, <i>Dutch</i>, <i>English</i>, <i>Portuguese</i>, <i>Austrians</i>, <i>Prussians</i>, and <i>Americans</i>. The work was published by
    the command of Yuen, the ex-Governor-General
    of Canton, who is considered
    one of the principal living literary characters
    of China, and it consists chiefly of
    extracts from the voluminous history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span> the province Kwang tung, published by
    his Excellency:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p class="center"><i>The Religion of the Hwy hwy, or Mahometans.</i><br />
    </p>
    <p>&quot;This religion is professed by various sorts
        of barbarians who live southerly beyond <i>Chen ching</i> (TsÃ©amba, or Zeampa), to the <i>Se
        yu</i>. Their doctrines originated in the kingdom
        of <i>Me tih no</i> (Medina). They say that
        heaven is the origin of all things; they do not
        use any images. Their country is close to TÃ«en
        choo (India); their customs are quite different
        from those of the Buddhists; they kill
        living creatures, but they do not eat indiscriminately
        all that is killed; they eat not hog's
        flesh, and this is the essence of the doctrine
        of Hwy hwy. They have now a foreign pagoda
        (<i>fan t&#259;</i>), near the temple of the compassionate
        saint (in Canton), which exists
        since the time of the Tang. It is of a spiral
        form, and 163 cubits high.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> They go every
        day therein to say prayers.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span></p>
<p>By the kindness of Dr. Morrison, the
    translator had the pleasure to converse
    with a member of the Mahometan
    clergy at Canton. He stated, that in the
    Mosque at Canton is a tablet, whereon it
    is written, that the religion of the Prophet
    of Mecca was brought to China, <i>Tang
    ching yuen san nÃ«en</i>, that is, in the third
    year of the period called <i>Ching yuen</i>,

    have taken their extract from the historical
    work of <i>Ho</i> (4051, M.); they seem
    not to have any knowledge of Matuanlin,
    where the Arabs are spoken of under the
    name of <i>Ta she</i>. See the notes to my
    translation of the Chronicle of Vahram,
    p. 76. During the time the translator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span> was at Canton, there arrived a pilgrim
    from Pekin on his way to Mecca.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p class="center"> <i>The Fa lan se, Francs and Frenchmen.</i></p>
    <p>&quot;The <i>Fa lan se</i> are also called <i>Fo lang se</i>, and
        now <i>Fo lang ke</i>. In the beginning they adopted
        the religion of Buddha, but afterwards they
        received the religion of the <i>Lord of Heaven</i>.
        They are assembled together and stay in <i>Leu
        song</i> (Spain?); they strive now very hard with
        the <i>Hung maou or red-haired people</i> (the <i>Dutch</i>),
        and the <i>Ying keih le</i> (<i>English</i>); but the <i>Fa lan
        se</i> have rather the worst of it. These
        foreigners, or barbarians (<i>e jin</i>) wear white
        caps and black woollen hats; they salute one
        another by taking off the hat. Regarding
        their garments and eating and drinking, they
        have the same customs as the people of
        Great <i>Leu song</i> and Small <i>Leu song</i> (<i>Spain</i> and <i>Manilla</i>).&quot;</p>

    Tribute as recorded under the present dynasty</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span> (<i>Memoirs</i>, l. c. p. 10 v., p. 11 r.). I
    am not sure if <i>Ke tsew</i> (10,869) <i>keu</i> (6,063) <i>Leu song</i>, can really be translated
    by the words&mdash;<i>they are assembled together
    and stay in Leu song</i>. The use of <i>tsew</i> in
    the place of <i>tseu</i> (10,826) is confirmed by
    the authorities in Kang he; but does Leu
    song really mean Spain? The Philippinas
    are called Leu song (Luzon), from the
    island whereon Manilla is, and in opposition
    to Spain (<i>Ta Leu song, the great
    L. s.</i>), <i>Seao Leu song</i>, <i>the small Leu
    song</i>. It may be doubted whether <i>Leu
    song</i> without <i>Ta</i>, <i>great</i>, can be taken for
    Spain. The Chinese have moreover learned
    from MatthÃ¦us Ricci the proper name
    of Spain, and write it <i>She pan ya</i>. The
    Dutch, the English, and the Germans,
    are, from a reddish colour of their hair,
    called <i>Hung maou</i>. This peculiar colour of
    the hair found among people of German
    origin, is often spoken of by the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span> Roman authors; as for instance in Tacitus,
    Germania, c. 4. Juvenal says, Sat.

<p>It would carry us too far at present to
    translate the statements of the Chinese
    concerning the Portuguese and Dutch.
    Under the head of <i>Se yang</i>, or Portugal,
    may be read an extract of the account of
    Europe (Gow lo pa) the Chinese received
    by Paulus MatthÃ¦us Ricci (<i>Le ma paou</i>).
    The Chinese know that the European Universities
    are divided into four faculties;
    and his Excellency Yuen is aware of the
    great similarity between the ceremonies
    of the Buddhists and those of the Roman
    Catholic church (l. c. 17 v). The present
    Translator of the &quot;History of the Pirates&quot;
    intends to translate the whole of the 57th
    book of the often-quoted Memoirs, and
    to subjoin copious extracts of other works,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span> particularly from the <i>Hae kw&#335; hÃ«en kÃ«en
    l&#259;h</i>, or &quot;Memoirs concerning the Empires
    surrounded by the Ocean.&quot; This very
    interesting small work is divided into two
    books; one containing the text, and the
    other the maps. The text consists of
    eight chapters, including a description of
    the sea-coast of China, with a map, constructed
    on a large scale, of the nations
    to the east, the south-east, and the south;
    then follows a topography of Portugal and
    Europe generally. Concerning England
    we find:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p class="center"> <i>The Kingdom of the Ying keih le, or English.</i> </p>
    <p>&quot;The kingdom of the <i>Ying keih le</i> is a dependent
        or tributary state<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> to <i>Ho lan</i> (Holland).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span> Their garments and manners in eating
        and drinking are the same. This kingdom
        is rather rich. The males use much cloth
        and like to drink wine. The females, before
        marriage, bind the waist, being desirous to
        look slender; their hair hangs in curls over
        the neck; they use a short garment and
        petticoats, but dress in a larger cloth when
        they go out. They take snuff out of boxes
        made from gold and threads.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;<i>Ying keih le</i> is a kingdom composed of three
        islands: it is in the middle of four kingdoms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span> called <i>Lin yin</i>:<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> <i>Hwang ke</i>, the <i>yellow flag</i> (Denmark), <i>Ho lan</i>, and <i>Fo lang se</i>. The <i>Great Western Ocean</i> (Europe) worships the
        Lord of Heaven; and there are, firstly, <i>She pan ya</i> (Spain), <i>Poo ke&#259;h ya</i> (Portugal),
        the <i>yellow flag</i>, &amp;c.; but there are too many
        kingdoms to nominate them one by one. Ying

</blockquote>
<p>This extract is taken from the <i>Hae kw&#335;
    hÃ«en kÃ«en l&#259;h</i>, book i. p. 34 v. 35 r; and
    I am sorry to see that in the &quot;Memoirs&quot;
    it is abbreviated in such a manner that
    the sense is materially changed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;<i>Ying keih le</i>,&quot; says the author of the <i>Hae kwo
        hÃ«en kÃ«en l&#259;h</i> (l. c.), &quot;is a realm composed out
        of three islands. To the west and the north
        of the four kingdoms of <i>Lin yin</i>, the <i>Yellow
        flag</i>, <i>Holan</i>, and <i>Fo lang se</i>, is the ocean. From
        Lin yin the ocean takes its direction to the
        east, and surrounds <i>Go lo sse</i> (Russia); and
        from Go lo sse, yet more to the east, <i>Se me le</i> (Siberia?). Through the northern sea you cannot
        sail; the sea is frozen, and does not
        thaw, and for this reason it is called the <i>Frozen Ocean</i>. From Lin yin, to the south,
        are the various empires of the <i>Woo</i> and <i>Kwei</i> (<i>Crows</i> and <i>Demons</i>), and they all belong
        to <i>the red-haired people</i> of the <i>Great Western
        Ocean</i>. On the west and on the north there
        are different barbarians under various names;</p>
    <p class="center"> *     *    *     *     *     *</p>

 <p>but they are, in one word, similar to the
        Go lo sse (Russians), who stay in the metropolis
        (Pekin). It is said that the <i>Kaou chun
        peih mow</i> (?) are similar to the inhabitants of
        the <i>Middle Empire</i>; they are of a vigorous
        body and an ingenious mind. All that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span> produce is fine and strong; their attention is
        directed to making fire-arms. They make
        researches in astronomy and geography, and
        generally they do not marry. Every kingdom
        has a particular language, and they greet
        one another by taking off the hat. They
        worship,&quot; &amp;c. (The same as p. xxx.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My copy of the <i>Hae kw&#335; hÃ«en kÃ«en l&#259;h</i> was printed in the province <i>Che keang</i>,
    in the year 1794.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;In the narrative regarding foreign countries,
        and forming part of the history of the Ming,
        the English are called <i>Yen go le</i>; in the <i>Hae
        kw&#335; hÃ«en kÃ«en l&#365;h</i>, Ying ke le (5272, 6950);
        but in the maps the name is now always
        written <i>Ying keih le</i> (5018, 6947). In expressing
        the sound of words we sometimes use
        different characters. This kingdom lies to the
        west of <i>Gow lo pa</i> (Europa), and was originally
        a tributary state to Ho lan (Holland); but in
        the course of time it became richer and more
        powerful than <i>Ho lan</i>, and revolted. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span> kingdoms are, therefore, enemies. It is not
        known at what time the Ying keih le grasped
        the country of North <i>O m&#335; le kea</i> (America),
        which is called <i>Kea no</i> (Canada). Great <i>Ying keih le</i> is a kingdom of Gow lo pa
        (Europe.)<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In the twelfth year of <i>Yung ching</i> (1735), they came the first time to Canton
        for trade. Their country produces wheat,
        with which they trade to all the neighboring
        countries. They are generally called <i>Keang he&#335;</i> (that is, English ships from India,
        or country ships), and there arrive many
        vessels.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This extract is taken from the <i>Tan chay
    hÃ«en kÃ«en l&#259;h</i>, and it is all that we find
    regarding England in the Memoirs concerning
    the south of the Mei ling Mountains
    (p. 18 r. v.). In the latter extract,
    the author appears to confound the country
    trade of India and China with that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span> the mother country. England is again
    mentioned in the notice regarding Me le
    keih (America), taken out of Yuen's
    History of Canton. It is there said, that
    the Me le keih passed, in the 52d year of
    KÃ«en lung (1788), the Bocca Tigris, and
    that they then separated from the Ying
    keih le (p. 19 r.) At the end of the extract
    concerning the Americans (p. 190)
    we read the following words:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;The characters which are used in the writings
        of these realms are, according to the
        statements of <i>Ma lo ko</i>, <i>twenty-six</i>; all sounds
        can be sufficiently expressed by these characters.
        Every realm has large and small
        characters; they are called <i>La ting</i> characters,
        and <i>La te na</i> (Latin) characters.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is pleasing to observe that his Excellency
    Yuen had some knowledge of
    Dr. Morrison's Dictionary. In the third
    part of his Dictionary, Dr. Morrison has
    given, in Chinese, a short and clear notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span> concerning the European alphabet. Yuen
    seems to have taken his statements from
    this notice, and to have written the name
    of the author, by a mistake, <i>Ma lo ko</i>,
    for <i>Ma le so</i>, as Dr. Morrison is generally
    called by the Chinese.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p class="center"> <i>The Man ying, the Double Eagle, or<br />
        Austrians.</i> </p>
    <p>&quot;The <i>Man ying</i> passed the Bocca Tigris the
        first time in the 45th year of KÃ«en lung (1781),
        and are called <i>Ta chen</i> (<i>Teutchen</i>). They
        have accepted the religion of the Lord of
        Heaven. In customs and manners they are
        similar to the Se yang, or Portuguese; they
        are the brethren of the Tan ying, or <i>Single
        eagle kingdom</i> (Prussia); in difficulties and
        distress they help one another. Their ships
        which came to Canton had a white flag, on
        which an eagle was painted with two heads.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This extract is taken from the History
    of <i>Yuen</i>. I take the liberty to observe,
    that the Chinese scholar must be careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span> not to take the <i>Sui chen</i>, or <i>Chen kw&#335;</i> (the
    Swedes), for the <i>Ta chen</i> (the <i>Teutchen</i>).
    In the <i>Memoirs</i>, l. c. p. 19 v., we read the
    following notice on the <i>Chen kw&#335;</i> (the
    Swedes):</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;The <i>Chen</i> realm is also called <i>Tan</i> (Denmark)
        realm, and now the <i>yellow flag</i>. This
        country is opposite to that of the <i>Ho lan</i>, and
        a little farther off from the sea. There are
        two realms called <i>Sui chen</i>, and they border
        both on the <i>Go lo sse</i>, or Russia. They
        passed the Bocca Tigris the first year of
        KÃ«en lung (1765).&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="center"> <i>The Tan ying, the Single Eagle or Prussians.</i> </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;The Tan ying passed the Bocca Tigris the
        52d year of KÃ«en lung (1788.) They live
        to the west and north of the Man ying (Austrians).
        In customs and manners they are
        similar to them. On their ships flies a white
        flag, on which an eagle is painted.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This last extract is also taken from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span> the History of Canton, published by his
    Excellency Yuen.</p>
<p>If we consider how easily the Chinese
    could procure information regarding foreign
    countries during the course of the
    two last centuries, and then see how
    shamefully they let pass all such opportunities
    to inform and improve themselves,
    we can only look upon these
    proud slaves of hereditary customs with
    the utmost disgust and contempt. The
    ancient Britons and Germans had no
    books; yet what perfect descriptions of
    those barbarian nations have been handed
    down to us by the immortal genius of
    Tacitus! Montesquieu says, that &quot;in
    CÃ¦sar and Tacitus we read the code of
    barbarian laws; and in the code we read
    CÃ¦sar and Tacitus.&quot; In the statement
    of the modern Chinese regarding foreign
    nations, we see, on the contrary, both
    the want of enquiry, and the childish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span> remarks of unenlightened and uncultivated
    minds.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<h2><a name="YING_HING_SOOs_PREFACE" id="YING_HING_SOOs_PREFACE">YING HING SOO's PREFACE.</a></h2>
<p>In the summer of the year <i>Ke sze</i> (1809),<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> I returned from the capital, and
    having passed the chain of mountains,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> I learned the extraordinary disturbances
    caused by the <i>Pirates</i>. When I came home
    I saw with mine own eyes all the calamities;
    four villages were totally destroyed;
    the inhabitants collected together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span> and made preparations for resistance.
    Fighting at last ceased on seas and
    rivers: families and villages rejoiced, and
    peace was every where restored. Hearing
    of our naval transactions, every man desired
    to have them written down in a history;
    but people have, until this day,
    looked in vain for such a work.</p>
<p>Meeting once, at a public inn in Whampo,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> with one <i>Yuen tsze</i>, we conversed
    together, when he took a volume in his
    hand, and asked me to read it. On opening
    the work, I saw that it contained a <i>History of the Pirates</i>; and reading it
    to the end, I found that the occurrences
    of those times were therein recorded
    from day to day, and that our naval transactions
    are there faithfully reported.
    Yuen tsze supplied the defect I stated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span> before, and anticipated what had occupied
    my mind for a long time. The affairs
    concerning the robber <i>Lin</i> are described by
    the non-official historian <i>Lan e</i>, in his <i>Tsing
    y&#301;h ke</i>, viz. in the <i>History of the Pacification
    of the Robbers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Respectfully looking
    to the commands of heaven, <i>Lan e</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span> made known, for all future times, the
    faithful and devoted servants of government.
    Yuen tsze's work is a supplement
    to the History of the Pacification of the
    Robbers, and you may rely on whatever
    therein is reported, whether it be of great
    or little consequence. Yuen tsze has
    overlooked nothing; and I dare to say,
    that all people will rejoice at the publication.
    Having written these introductory
    lines to the said work, I returned it
    to Yuen tsze.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>My house being near the sea, we were,
    during the year <i>Ke sze</i> of KÃ«a king (1809),
    disturbed by the Pirates. The whole coast
    adjoining to our town was in confusion,
    and the inhabitants dispersed; this lasting
    for a long time, every man felt annoyed
    at it. In the year <i>K&#259;ng yin</i> (1830)
    I met with <i>Yuen tsze yung lun</i> at a public
    inn within the walls of the provincial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span> metropolis (Canton). He showed me his <i>History of the Pacification of the Pirates</i>,
    and asked me to write a Preface to the
    work; having been a schoolfellow of his
    in my tender age, I could not refuse his
    request. Opening and reading the volume,
    I was moved with recollections of occurrences
    in former days, and I was pleased
    with the diligence and industry of <i>Yuen
    keun</i><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The author was so careful to
    combine what he had seen and heard,
    that I venture to say it is an historical
    work on which you may rely.</p>
<p>We have the collections of former historians,
    who in a fine style described things
    as they happened, that by such faithful
    accounts the world might be governed,
    and the minds of men enlightened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span> People may learn by these vast collections<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> what should be done, and what
    not. It is, therefore, desirable that
    facts may be arranged in such a manner,
    that books should give a faithful
    account of what happened. There are
    magistrates who risk their life, excellent
    females who maintain their virtue,
    and celebrated individuals who protect
    their native places with a strong
    hand; they behave themselves valiantly,
    and overlook private considerations, if
    the subject concerns the welfare of the
    people at large. Without darkness, there
    is no light; without virtue, there is no
    splendour. In the course of time we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span> heard of many persons of such qualities;
    but how few books exist by which the
    authors benefit their age!</p>

<p>There have been pirates from the oldest<span class="sidenote">(1 r.)</span>
    times in the eastern sea of Canton; they arose
    and disappeared alternately, but never were they
    so formidable as in the years of KÃ«a king,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> at
    which time, being closely united together, it was
    indeed very difficult to destroy them. Their
    origin must be sought for in Annam.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> year fifty-six of KÃ«en lung (1792), a certain
    Kwang ping yuen, joined by his two brothers,
    Kwang e and Kwang kw&#335;, took Annam by force,<span class="sidenote">(1 v.)</span> and expelled its legitimate king Wei ke le.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Le retired into the province Kwang se, and was
    made a general by our government. But his
    younger brother Fuh ying came in the sixth year
    of KÃ«a king (1802) with an army from Siam and
    Laos,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and killed Kwang ping in a great battle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> The son of the usurper, called King shing,
    went on board a ship with the minister Yew
    kin meih, and Meih joined the pirates, Ching
    tsih, Tung hae pa, and others, who rambled
    about these seas at this time. The pirate Ching
    tsih was appointed a king's officer, under the
    name of <i>master of the stables</i>. King shing, relying
    on the force of his new allies, which consisted
    of about two hundred vessels, manned<span class="sidenote">(2 r.)</span> with a resolute and warlike people, returned in
    the twelfth moon of the same year (1803) into
    that country with an armed force, and joined
    by Ching tsih, at night time took possession of
    the bay of Annam. The legitimate king Fuh
    ying collected an army, but being beaten repeatedly,
    he tried in vain to retire to Laos.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<p>Ching tsih being a man who had lived all his
    life on the water, behaved himself, as soon
    as he got possession of the bay of Annam, in
    a tyrannical way to the inhabitants; he took
    what he liked, and, to say it in one word, his
    will alone was law. His followers conducted
    themselves in the same manner; trusting to
    their power and strength, they were cruel and
    violent against the people; they divided the
    whole population among themselves, and took
    their wives and daughters by force. The inhabitants
    felt very much annoyed at this behaviour,
    and attached themselves more strongly
    to Fuh ying. They fixed a day on which some
    of the king's officers should make an attack on
    the sea-side, while the king himself with his
    general was to fight the van of the enemy, the<span class="sidenote">(2 v.)</span> people to rise <i>en masse</i>, and to run to arms, in
    order that they should be overwhelming by
    their numbers. Fuh ying was delighted at these
    tidings, and on the appointed day a great battle
    was fought, in which Ching tsih not being able
    to superintend all from the rear-guard to the
    van, and the people pressing besides very hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> towards the centre, he was totally vanquished
    and his army destroyed. He himself died of a
    wound which he received in the battle. His
    younger brother Ching y&#301;h, the usurper, King
    shing, and his nephew Pang shang, with many
    others ran away. Ching y&#301;h, their chief, joined
    the pirates with his followers, who in these times
    robbed and plundered on the ocean indiscriminately.
    This was a very prosperous period for
    the pirates. So long as Wang pÃ«aou remained
    admiral in these seas, all was peace and quietness
    both on the ocean and the sea-shore. The admiral
    gained repeated victories over the bandits;<span class="sidenote">(3 r.)</span> but as soon as Wang pÃ«aou died, the
    pirates divided themselves into different
    squadrons, which sailed under various colours.
    There existed six large squadrons, under
    different flags, the <i>red</i>, the <i>yellow</i>, the <i>green</i>, the <i>blue</i>, the <i>black</i>, and the <i>white</i>. These wasps
    of the ocean were called after their different
    commanders, <i>Ching y&#301;h</i>, <i>Woo che tsing</i>, <i>Meih yew
    kin</i>, <i>O po tai</i>, <i>LÃ«ang paou</i>, and <i>Le shang tsing</i>.
    To every one of these large squadrons belonged
    smaller ones, commanded by a deputy. Woo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> che tsing, whose nick-name was <i>Tung hae pa</i>,
    the <i>Scourge of the Eastern Sea</i>,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> was commander
    of the <i>yellow</i> flag, and Le tsung hoo his deputy.
    Meih yew kin and NÃ«aou shih, who for
    this reason was called <i>Bird</i> and <i>stone</i>, were the
    commanders of the <i>blue</i> flag, and their deputies
    Meih's brethren, Yew kwei and Yew kÃ«e. A
    certain Hae kang and another person Hwang ho,
    were employed as spies. O po tai, who afterwards
    changed his name to <i>Lustre of instruction</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> was<span class="sidenote">(3 v.)</span> the commander of the <i>black</i> flag, and Ping yung
    ta, Chang jih kÃ«aou, and O tsew he, were his
    deputies. LÃ«ang paou, nicknamed Tsung ping
    paou, The <i>jewel of the whole crew</i>, was the commander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> of the <i>white</i> flag. Le shang tsing, nicknamed <i>The frog's meal</i>, was the commander of
    the <i>green</i>; and Ching y&#301;h of the <i>red</i> flag.
    Every flag was appointed to cruise in a particular
    channel. There was at this time a gang
    of robbers in the province Fo kÃ«en, known by
    the name of Kwei kÃ«en (6760, 5822); they
    also joined the pirates, who became so numerous
    that it was impossible to master them. We
    must in particular mention a certain <i>Chang paou</i>,
    a notorious character in after-times. Under
    Chang paou were other smaller squadrons, commanded
    by Suh ke lan (nicknamed <i>Both odour
    and mountain</i>) LÃ«ang po paou, Suh puh gow,
    and others. Chang paou himself belonged to
    the squadron of Ching y&#301;h saou, or the <i>wife of
    Ching y&#301;h</i>,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> so that the red flag alone was
    stronger than all the others united together.</p>
<div class="sidenote">(4 r.)</div>
<p>There are three water passages or channels
    along the sea-shore, south of the Mei ling
    mountains;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> one goes eastward to <i>Hwy</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> <i>Chaou</i><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>; the other westward to <i>Kao</i>, <i>LÃ«en</i>, <i>Luy</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> <i>KÃ«ung</i>, <i>Kin</i>, <i>Tan</i>, <i>Yae</i> and <i>Wan</i>;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and a third
    between these two, to <i>Kwang</i> and <i>Chow</i>.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> ocean surrounds these passages, and here trading
    vessels from all the world meet together,
    wherefore this track is called &quot;<i>The great meeting</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span><i> from the east and the south</i>.&quot; The piratical
    squadrons dividing between them the water
    passages and the adjoining coasts, robbed and
    carried away all that fell into their hands. Both
    the eastern and the middle passage have been
    retained by the three piratical squadrons, Ching
    y&#301;h saou, O po tae, and Leang paou; the western
    passage was under the three others, nicknamed <i>Bird and stone</i>, <i>Frog's meal</i>, and the <i>Scourge of the</i><span class="sidenote">(4 v.)</span><i> eastern sea</i>. Peace and quietness was not
    known by the inhabitants of the sea-coast for
    a period of ten years. On the side from <i>Wei
    chow</i> and <i>Neaou chow</i><a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> farther on to the sea, the
    passage was totally cut off; scarcely any man
    came hither. In this direction is a small island,
    surrounded on all sides by high mountains,
    where in stormy weather a hundred vessels
    find a safe anchorage; here the pirates retired
    when they could not commit any robberies.
    This land contains fine paddy fields, and abounds
    in all kinds of animals, flowers, and fruits. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> island was the lurking-place of the robbers,
    where they stayed and prepared all the stores
    for their shipping.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1807. (5 r.)</div>
<p>Chang paou was a native of Sin hwy, near the
    mouth of the river,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and the son of a fisherman.
    Being fifteen years of age, he went with his
    father a fishing in the sea, and they were consequently
    taken prisoners by Ching y&#301;h, who
    roamed about the mouth of the river, ravaging
    and plundering. Ching y&#301;h saw Paou, and
    liked him so much, that he could not depart
    from him. Paou was indeed a clever fellow&mdash;he
    managed all business very well; being also a
    fine young man, he became a favourite of Ching
    y&#301;h,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and was made a head-man or captain. It
    happened, that on the seventeenth day of the
    tenth moon, in the twentieth year of KÃ«a king
    (about the end of 1807), Ching y&#301;h perished in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> a heavy gale, and his legitimate wife <i>Sh&#301;h</i> placed the whole crew under the sway of Paou;
    but so that she herself should be considered
    the Commander of all the squadrons together,&mdash;for
    this reason the division Ching y&#301;h was then <span class="sidenote">(5 v.)</span> called <i>Ching y&#301;h saou</i>, or <i>the wife of Ching
    y&#301;h</i>.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Being chief captain, Paou robbed and
    plundered incessantly, and daily increased his
    men and his vessels. He made the three following
    regulations:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquot">First:</p>
<p class="blockquot"><i>If any man goes privately on shore, or what
    is called transgressing the bars, he shall be
    taken and his ears be perforated in the presence of
    the whole fleet; repeating the same act, he shall
    suffer death.</i></p>
<p class="blockquot">Second:</p>
<div class="sidenote">1807.</div>
<p class="blockquot"><i>Not the least thing shall be taken privately from
    the stolen and plundered goods. All shall be registered,
    and the pirate receive for himself, out of</i><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a> <i>ten parts, only two; eight parts belong to the storehouse,
    called the general fund; taking any thing
    out of this general fund, without permission, shall
    be death.</i></p>
<p class="blockquot">Third:</p>
<div class="sidenote"> (6 r.) </div>
<p class="blockquot"><i>No person shall debauch at his pleasure captive
    women taken in the villages and open places, and
    brought on board a ship; he must first request the
    ship's purser for permission, and then go aside in
    the ship's hold. To use violence against any woman,
    or to wed her without permission, shall be punished
    with death.</i><a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">1807.</div>
<p>That the pirates might never feel want of provisions,
    Chang paou gained the country people
    to their interest. It was ordered, that wine, rice,
    and all other goods, should be paid for to the
    villagers; it was made capital punishment to
    take any thing of this kind by force or without
    paying for it. For this reason the pirates were
    never in want of gunpowder, provisions, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> other necessaries. By this strong discipline the
    whole crew of the fleet was kept in order.</p>
<p>The wife of Ching y&#301;h was very strict in every
    transaction; nothing could be done without a
    written application. Anything which had been
    taken, or plundered, was regularly entered on
    the register of the storehouse. The pirates received
    out of this common fund what they were
    in need of, and nobody dared to have private<span class="sidenote">(6 v.)</span> possessions. If on a piratical expedition any
    man left the line of battle, whether by advancing
    or receding, every pirate might accuse him
    at a general meeting, and on being found guilty,
    he was beheaded. Knowing how watchful
    Chang paou was on every side, the pirates took
    great care to behave themselves well.</p>
<p>The pirates used to call the purser, or secretary
    of the storehouse, <i>Ink and writing master</i>;
    and they called their piratical plunder only <i>a
    transhipping of goods</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1807.</div>
<p>There was a temple in <i>Hwy chow</i> dedicated
    to the <i>spirits of the three mothers</i>,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> near the sea-coast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> and many came thither to worship. The
    pirates visited this place whenever they passed it
    with their vessels, pretending to worship; but
    this was not the case&mdash;they thought of mischief,
    and had only their business to attend. Once
    they came with the commander at their head,
    as if to worship, but they laid hold on the image
    or statue to take it away. They tried in vain
    from morning to the evening,&mdash;they were all
    together not able to move it. Chang paou<span class="sidenote">(7 r.)</span> alone<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> was able to raise the image, and being a
    fair wind, he gave order to bring it on board a
    ship. All who were concerned in this transaction
    feared to find, from the wrath of the spirit,
    their death in the piratical expeditions. They
    all prayed to escape the vengeance of heaven.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1808.</div>
<p>On the seventh moon of the thirteenth year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> the naval officer of the garrison at the Bocca
    Tigris,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Kw&#335; lang lin, sailed into the sea to fight
    the pirates.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Chang paou was informed by his
    spies of this officer's arrival, and prepared an
    ambush in a sequestered bay. He met Kw&#335; lang
    on a false attack, with a few vessels only; but
    twenty-five vessels came from behind, and the
    pirates surrounded Kw&#335; lang's squadron in three<span class="sidenote">(7 v.)</span> lines near Ma chow yang.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> There followed a
    fierce battle, which lasted from the morning to
    the evening; it was impossible for Kw&#335; lang to
    break through the enemy's lines, and he determined
    to die fighting. Paou advanced; but
    Lang fought exceedingly hard against him. He
    loaded a gun and fired it at Paou, who perceiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> the gun directed against him, gave way.
    Seeing this, the people thought he was wounded
    and dying; but as soon as the smoke vanished
    Paou stood again firm and upright, so that all
    thought he was a spirit. The pirates instantly
    grappled Kw&#335; lang's ship; Paou was the foremost,
    and Leang po paou the first to mount
    the vessel; he killed the helmsman, and took
    the ship. The pirates crowded about; the
    commander Kw&#335; lang engaging with small
    arms, much blood was shed. This murderous<span class="sidenote">(8 r.)</span> battle lasted till night time; the bodies of the
    dead surrounded the vessels on all sides, and
    there perished an immense number of the pirates.
    Between three and five o'clock the pirates had
    destroyed or sunk three of our vessels. The other
    officers of Kw&#335; being afraid that they also might
    perish in the sea, displayed not all their strength;
    so it happened that the pirates making a sudden
    attack, captured the whole remaining fifteen
    vessels. Paou wished very much that Kw&#335;
    lang would surrender, but Lang becoming
    desperate, suddenly seized the pirate by
    the hair, and grinned at him. The pirate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> spoke kindly to him, and tried to soothe him.
    Lang, seeing himself deceived in his expectation,
    and that he could not attain death by such
    means, committed suicide,&mdash;being then a man
    of seventy years of age. Paou had really no intention
    to put Kw&#335; lang to death, and he was
    exceedingly sorry at what happened. &quot;We<span class="sidenote">(8 v.)</span> others,&quot; said Paou, &quot;are like vapours dispersed
    by the wind; we are like the waves of the sea,
    roused up by a whirlwind; like broken bamboo-sticks
    on the sea, we are floating and sinking
    alternately, without enjoying any rest. Our
    success in this fierce battle will, after a short
    time, bring the united strength of government
    on our neck. If they pursue us in the different
    windings and bays of the sea&mdash;they have maps
    of them<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>&mdash;should we not get plenty to do? Who
    will believe that it happened not by my command,
    and that I am innocent of the death of
    this officer? Every man will charge me with
    the wanton murder of a commander, after he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> been vanquished and his ships taken? And they
    who have escaped will magnify my cruelty.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> If
    I am charged with the murder of this officer,
    how could I venture, if I should wish in future
    times, to submit myself? Would I not be treated<span class="sidenote">(9 r.)</span> according to the supposed cruel death of Kw&#335;
    lang?&quot;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1808.</div>
<p>At the time that Kw&#335; lang was fighting very
    bravely, about ten fisher-boats asked of the major
    Pang noo of the town HÃ«ang shan,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> to lend
    them the large guns, to assist the commander;
    but the major being afraid these fishermen
    might join the pirates,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> refused their request.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> And thus it happened, that the commander himself
    perished with many others. There were in the
    battle three of my friends: the lieutenant Tao
    tsae lin, Tse&#335; tang hoo, and Ying tang hwang,
    serving under the former. Lin and Hoo were
    killed, but Hwang escaped when all was surrounded
    with smoke, and he it was who told me
    the whole affair.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1808.</div>
<p>On the eighth moon the general Lin fa went
    out as commander to make war against the
    pirates; but on seeing that they were so numerous,
    he became afraid, and all the other officers
    felt apprehensions; he therefore tried to retire,
    but the pirates pursued after, and came up with
    him near a place called Olang pae.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The vessels<span class="sidenote">(9 v.)</span> in the front attacked the pirates, who were not able
    to move, for there happened to be a calm. But
    the pirates leaped into the water, and came
    swimming towards our vessels. Our commander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> not being able to prevent this by force, six vessels
    were taken; and he himself, with ten other
    men, were killed by the pirates.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1808.</div>
<p>A very large trading vessel called Teaou fa,
    coming back laden with goods from Annam
    and Tung king,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> had a desperate skirmish with
    the pirates. Chang paou, knowing very well
    that he could not take her by force, captured
    two ferry boats, and the pirates concealed themselves
    therein. Under the mask of ferrymen the
    pirates pursued after, and called upon Teaou fa to
    stop. Fa, confident in her strength, and that
    victory would be on her side, let the ferrymen
    come near, as if she had not been aware of the<span class="sidenote">(10 r.)</span> deceit. But as soon as the pirates laid hold of
    the ropes to board her, the trader's crew made a
    vigorous resistance, and the pirates could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> avail themselves of their knives and arrows&mdash;guns
    they had not&mdash;the vessel being too large.
    There were killed about ten hands in attacking
    this vessel, and the pirates retired to their boat;
    a circumstance which never happened before.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>On the second moon of the fourteenth year,
    the admiral <i>Tsuen mow sun</i> went on board his
    flag vessel, called Mih teng, and proceeded with
    about one hundred other vessels to attack the
    pirates. They were acquainted with his design
    by their spies, and gathered together round
    Wan shan;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> the admiral following them in four
    divisions. The pirates, confident in their numbers,
    did not withdraw, but on the contrary
    spread out their line, and made a strong attack.
    Our commander looked very lightly on them,<span class="sidenote">(10 v.)</span> yet a very fierce battle followed, in which many
    were killed and wounded. The ropes and sails
    having been set on fire by the guns,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> the pirates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> became exceeding afraid and took them away.
    The commander directed his fire against the
    steerage, that they might not be able to steer their
    vessels. Being very close one to the other, the
    pirates were exposed to the fire of all the four
    lines at once. The pirates opened their eyes in
    astonishment and fell down; our commander
    advanced courageously, laid hold of their vessels,
    killed an immense number of men, and took
    about two hundred prisoners. There was a
    pirate's wife in one of the boats, holding so fast
    by the helm that she could scarcely be taken
    away. Having two cutlasses, she desperately
    defended herself, and wounded some soldiers;
    but on being wounded by a musket-ball, she<span class="sidenote">(11 r.)</span> fell back into the vessel and was taken prisoner.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>About this time, when the red squadron was
    assembled in Kwang chow wan, or the Bay of
    Kwang chow, Tsuen mow sun went to attack
    them; but he was not strong enough. The wife
    of Ching y&#301;h remained quiet; but she ordered
    Chang paou to make an attack on the front of our
    line with ten vessels, and Leang po paou to come
    from behind. Our commander fought in the van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> and in the rear, and made a dreadful slaughter;
    but there came suddenly two other pirates, HÃ«ang
    shang url, and Suh puh king, who surrounded
    and attacked our commander on all sides. Our
    squadron was scattered, thrown into disorder,
    and consequently cut to pieces; there was a<span class="sidenote">(11 v.)</span> noise which rent the sky; every man fought in
    his own defence, and scarcely a hundred remained
    together. The squadron of Ching y&#301;h
    overpowered us by numbers; our commander
    was not able to protect his lines, they were
    broken, and we lost fourteen vessels.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>Our men of war, escorting some merchant
    vessels, in the fourth moon of the same year,
    happened to meet the pirate nicknamed <i>The
    Jewel of the whole crew</i>, cruizing at sea near a
    place called Tang pae ke&#335;, outside of TsÃ«aou
    mun. The traders became exceedingly frightened,
    but our commander said: &quot;This not
    being the red flag, we are a match for them,
    therefore we will attack and conquer them.&quot;
    Then ensued a battle; they attacked each
    other with guns and stones, and many people
    were killed and wounded. The fighting ceased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> towards the evening, and began again next<span class="sidenote">(12 r.)</span> morning. The pirates and the men of war
    were very close to each other, and they boasted
    mutually about their strength and valour. It
    was a very hard fight; the sound of cannon
    and the cries of the combatants were heard
    some le<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> distant. The traders remained at some
    distance; they saw the pirates mixing gun-powder
    in their beverage,&mdash;they looked instantly
    red about the face and the eyes, and then
    fought desperately<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> This fighting continued
    three days and nights incessantly; at last becoming
    tired on both sides, they separated.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>On the eighth day of the fifth moon the pirates
    left their lurking place, attacked Kan chuh han,
    and burned and plundered the houses. On the
    tenth they burned and plundered Kew kÃ«ang,<span class="sidenote">(12 v.)</span> Sha kow, and the whole sea-coast; they then
    turned about to KÃ«e chow, went on shore, and
    carried away fifty-three women by force. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> went to sea again the following day, burned and
    plundered on their way about one hundred houses
    in Sin hwy and Shang sha, and took about a
    hundred persons of both sexes prisoners.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>On the sixth moon, the admiral Ting kwei
    heu went to sea. Wishing to sail eastward, but
    falling in with heavy rains for some days, he
    stopped near Kwei kÃ«a mun,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and engaged in
    settling concerning his ballast. On the eighth
    day of this moon, Chang paou, availing himself
    of the bad weather, explored the station in a
    small boat and passed the place. Ting kwei was
    right in thinking that the pirates would not undertake
    any thing during these heavy rains; but
    he was careless regarding what might happen
    after it. Indeed, as the weather cleared up on
    the morning of the ninth, Chang paou appeared
    suddenly before the admiral, and formed a line<span class="sidenote">(13 r.)</span> of two hundred vessels. Ting kwei having no
    sails ready, and all the ships being at anchor,
    could by no means escape the pirates. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> officers, being afraid of the large number of the
    enemy, stood pale with apprehension near the
    flagstaff, unwilling to fight. The admiral spoke
    to them in a very firm manner, and said: &quot;By
    your fathers and mothers, by your wives and
    children, do your duty; fight and destroy these
    robbers. Every man must die: but should we
    be so happy as to escape, our rewards from government
    will be immense. Should we fall in the
    defence of our country, think that the whole force
    of the empire will be roused, and they will try by
    all means to destroy these banditti.&quot; They now
    all united together in a furious attack, and sustained<span class="sidenote">(13 v.)</span> it for a long time: Ting kwei fired his
    great guns,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and wounding the ringleader, nicknamed <i>The Jewel of the whole crew</i>, he fell down
    dead.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>The pirates were now at a loss how to proceed;
    but they received succour, while the force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> of our commander diminished every moment.
    About noon Paou drew nearer to the vessel of
    Ting kwei, attacked her with small arms, and
    sustained a great loss. But Leang po paou
    suddenly boarded the vessel, and the crew was
    thrown into disorder. Ting kwei seeing that
    he was unable to withstand, committed suicide;
    while an immense number of his men perished
    in the sea, and twenty-five vessels were lost.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>Our former deputy-governor Pih ling was
    about this time removed from his situation in
    the three <i>KÃ«ang</i> to become governor-general of
    the two Kwang.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> People said, now that Pih<span class="sidenote">(14 r.)</span> comes we shall not be overpowered by the
    pirates. Old men crowded about the gates of
    the public offices to make enquiries; the government
    officers appeared frightened and held
    consultations day and night, and the soldiers
    were ordered by a public placard to hold themselves
    ready to march. &quot;Since the death of
    Wang pÃ«aou,&quot; it was said, &quot;all commanders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> were unfortunate. Last year <i>Kw&#335; lang lin</i> was
    killed in the battle at <i>Ma chow</i>; <i>Tsuen mow sun</i> was unlucky at <i>Gaou kow</i>, <i>Url lin</i> ran away like
    a coward at <i>Lang pae</i>, and now <i>Ting kwei</i> has<span class="sidenote">(14 v.)</span> again been routed at <i>Kwei kÃ«a</i>. If the valiant
    men let their spirits droop, and the soldiers themselves
    become frightened at these repeated defeats,
    the pirates will certainly overpower us at
    last; we can really not look for any assistance
    to destroy them. We must try to cut off all
    provisions, and starve them.&quot; In consequence
    of this, all vessels were ordered to remain, or
    to return into harbour, that the pirates might not
    have any opportunity to plunder, and thus be
    destroyed by famine. The government officers
    being very vigilant about this regulation, the
    pirates were not able to get provisions for some
    months; they became at last tired of it, and
    resolved to go into the river itself.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>The pirates came now into the river by three
    different passages.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The wife of Ching y&#301;h
    plundered about Sin hwy, Chang paou about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> Tung kwan,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and O po tae about Fan yu<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and
    Shun tih, and all other smaller places connected<span class="sidenote">(15 r.)</span> with Shun tih; they were together explored
    by the pirates, who guarded the passage
    from Fan to Shun.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>On the first day of the seventh moon, O po tae
    came with about a hundred vessels and burnt
    the custom-house of Tsze ne. On the second day
    he divided his squadron into four divisions, extending
    to Peih kÃ«ang, Wei yung, Lin yo, Sh&#301;h
    peih, and other villages. The <i>Chang lung</i> division<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> surrounded the whole country from Ta
    wang yin to Shwy sse ying. The <i>Ta chow</i>, or
    large-vessel division, blockaded Ke kung sh&#301;h,
    which is below the custom-house of Tsze ne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> The pirates sent to the village Tsze ne, demanding
    ten thousand pieces of money<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> as tribute;
    and of San shen, a small village near Tsze ne
    on the right side, they demanded two thousand.<span class="sidenote">(15 v.)</span> The villagers differed in opinion; one
    portion would have granted the tribute, another
    would not. That part who wished to pay the
    tribute said: &quot;The pirates are very strong; it
    is better to submit ourselves now, and to give
    the tribute that we may get rid of them for
    awhile; we may then with leisure think on
    means of averting any misfortunes which may
    befall us. Our villages are near the coast, we
    shall be surrounded and compelled to do what
    they like, for no passage is open by which
    we can retire. How can we, under such
    circumstances, be confident and rely on our own
    strength?&quot;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>The other part, who would not grant the tribute,
    said: &quot;The pirates will never be satisfied;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> if we give them the tribute now, we shall
    not be able to pay it on another day. If they
    should make extortions a second time, when
    should we get money to comply with their
    demands? Why should we not rather spend
    the two thousand pieces of money to encourage
    government officers and the people? If we<span class="sidenote">(16 r.)</span> fight and happen to be victorious, our place
    will be highly esteemed; but if, what heaven
    may prevent, we should be unlucky, we shall
    be everywhere highly spoken of.&quot; The day
    drew to its end, and they could not agree in
    what they should determine on, when one villager
    arose and said: &quot;The banditti will repeatedly
    visit us, and then it will be impossible to pay
    the tribute; <i>we must fight</i>.&quot;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>As soon as it was resolved to resist the demands
    of the pirates, weapons were prepared,
    and all able men, from sixteen years and upwards
    to sixty, were summoned to appear with
    their arms near the palisades. They kept quiet
    the whole of the second day, and proceeded not
    to fighting; but the people were much disturbed,
    and did not sleep the whole night. On the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> day they armed and posted themselves
    on the sea-coast. The pirates, seeing that the<span class="sidenote">(16 v.)</span> villagers would not pay the tribute, became enraged,
    and made a severe attack during the
    night; but they could not pass the ditch before
    the village. On the morning of the fourth, O po
    tae headed his men, forced the ditch, took the
    provisions, and killed the cattle. The pirates
    in great numbers went on shore; but the villagers
    made such a vigorous resistance that they
    began to withdraw. O po tae therefore surrounded
    the village on both sides, and the pirates
    took possession of the mountain in the rear;
    they then threw the frightened villagers into disorder,
    pursued them, and killed about eighty.
    After this the pirates proceeded with their van
    to the sea-shore, without encountering any resistance
    from the front. The villagers were
    from the beginning very much alarmed for their<span class="sidenote">(17 r.)</span> wives and daughters; they collected them in
    the temple and shut it up. But the pirates
    being victorious, opened the temple, and carried
    the women by force all away on board ship.
    One pirate set off with two very fine women;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> a villager, on seeing this, pursued after and
    killed him in a hidden place. He then took the
    women and carried them safe through the water,&mdash;this
    was a servant. A great number of the
    pirates were killed and wounded, and the villagers
    lost about two thousand persons. What
    a cruel misfortune! it is hard indeed only to
    relate it.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>On the third day of the moon the people of
    Ta ma chow, hearing that the pirates were
    coming near, ran away. The pirates plundered
    all that was left behind, clothes, cattle, and provisions.
    On the sixth day they came so far as<span class="sidenote">(17 v.)</span> Ping chow and San shan. On the eighth they
    retired to Shaou wan, made an attack upon it
    on the ninth, but could not take it. On the
    tenth they ascended the river with the tide,
    went on shore, and burned Wei shih tun. On
    the eleventh day they came to our village, but
    retired again at night on command. On the
    twelfth they attacked Hwang yung, and left it
    again on the thirteenth. They retired on the
    fourteenth, and stopped at Nan pae. On the
    fifteenth they sailed out of the Bocca<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> Tigris,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and on the twenty-sixth attacked the
    ships which bring the tribute from Siam,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> but
    were not strong enough to capture them. On
    the twenty-ninth they attacked the places Tung<span class="sidenote">(18 r.)</span> hwan and Too shin, and killed nearly a thousand
    men.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>The pirates tried many stratagems and
    frauds to get into the villages. One came as
    a country gentleman to take charge of the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> guns; another came in a government
    vessel as if to assist the village; after which
    they on a sudden attacked and plundered all,
    when people were not aware of them. One
    pirate went round as a pedlar, to see and hear
    all, and to explore every place. The country
    people became therefore at last enraged, and
    were in future always on their guard. If they
    found any foreigner, they took him for a pirate
    and killed him. So came once a government
    officer on shore to buy rice; but the inhabitants
    thought he was a pirate and killed him. There
    was every where a degree of confusion, which
    it is impossible to explain.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>On the sixteenth day of the seventh moon,
    the pirates attacked a village near Tung kwan.<span class="sidenote">(18 v.)</span> The villagers knowing what would happen,
    made fences and palisades, and obstructed the
    passage with large guns. Armed with lances
    and targets they hid themselves in a secret place,
    and selected ten men only to oppose the pirates.
    The pirates seeing that there were so few people,
    went on shore to pursue them. As soon as
    they came near the ambuscade the guns were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> fired; the pirates became alarmed and dared
    not advance farther. Not being hurt by the fire,
    they again advanced; but three pirates presuming
    that there was an ambush, thought of retreating,
    and being very hard pressed by the
    enemy, they gave a sign to their comrades to
    come on shore. The ten villagers then retired
    near the ambush, and when the pirates pursued
    them, about a hundred were killed by their guns,
    and the whole force of the banditti was brought
    into disorder. The villagers pursued them killing<span class="sidenote">(19 r.)</span> many; those also who had been taken alive
    were afterwards beheaded. They captured one
    small and two large vessels.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>On the eighteenth day of the eighth moon
    the wife of Ching y&#301;h came with about five
    hundred vessels from Tung kwan and Sin hwy,
    and caused great commotion in the town Shun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> tih, HÃ«ang shan, and the neighbouring places.
    The squadron stopped at Tan chow, and on the
    twentieth Chang pao was ordered to attack
    Shaou ting with three hundred vessels. He
    carried away about four hundred people, both
    male and female; he came also to the palisades
    of our village, but could not penetrate inside.
    The twenty-first he came to Lin tow, and the
    twenty-second to Kan shin; he made an attack,
    but could not overpower the place; he
    then returned to Pwan pÃ«en jow, and lay before
    its fence. The inhabitants of Chow po chin,<span class="sidenote">(19 v.)</span> knowing that the pirates would make an attack,
    assembled behind the wall to oppose them.
    The pirates fired their guns and wounded some,
    when the villagers ran away. The pirates
    then went on shore, but the villagers crowded
    together and fired on them; the pirates cast
    themselves on the ground, and the shots passed
    over their heads without doing any harm. Before
    the gunners could again load, the pirates
    sprang up and put them to death. Out of the
    three thousand men who were in the battle,
    five hundred were carried away by the pirates.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> One of the most daring pirates, bearing the
    flag, was killed by the musket of a villager; a
    second pirate then took the flag, and he also
    was killed. The pirates now pressed against
    the wall and advanced. There was also a foreign
    pirate<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> engaged in the battle with a<span class="sidenote">(20 r.)</span> fowling-piece. The pirates assembled in great
    numbers to cut the wall with their halberts, but
    they were disappointed on seeing they could
    not attain their object in such a manner. The
    pirates lost their hold, fell down, and were killed.
    The engagement now became general, and great
    numbers were killed and wounded on both
    sides. The villagers at last were driven from
    their fortifications, and the pirates pursued them
    to <i>Mih ke</i>, or <i>the rocks about Mih</i>, where they
    were hindered from going farther by foggy
    weather; they retired and burned about twenty
    houses, with all they contained. On the following
    day the pirates appeared again on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> shore, but the inhabitants made a vigorous resistance,
    and being driven back, they retired to
    the citadel <i>Chih hwa</i>, where a thousand of them
    fought so hard that the pirates withdrew. It<span class="sidenote">(20 v.)</span> was reported that ten of them were killed, and
    that the villagers lost eight men. On the twenty-third
    the wife of Ching y&#301;h ordered O po tae to
    go up the river with about eighty vessels: he
    stopped at Show ke and Kung shih. On the
    twenty-fourth Chang paou and Po tae divided
    this district between themselves, and robbed
    and burned all. Pao had to plunder the north
    part to Fo shin; he carried away about ten
    thousand stones of rice,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and burned down about
    thirty houses; on the twenty-fifth he went to Se
    shin. O po tae came and burnt San heung keih;
    he then plundered Hwang yung, and came to
    KÃ«en ke, but did not make an attack against it.
    He afterwards returned and laid waste Cha
    yung.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1809. (21 r.)</div>
<p>On the twenty-sixth Chang paou went up the
    river to Nan hae<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and Lan sh&#301;h. In the harbour
    of the place were six rice vessels; and as soon
    as Paou was in Lan sh&#301;h he made preparations
    to capture these vessels. The military officer,
    seeing that the pirates were numerous, remained
    however on his station, for the instant he
    would have moved, Paou would have attacked
    and captured him. Paou proceeded then against
    the village itself; but the officer Ho shaou yuen
    headed the inhabitants, and made some resistance.
    The pirates, nevertheless, mounted the
    banks; and the villagers seeing their strength,
    did not stay to fight&mdash;they became frightened
    and ran away: all the others ran away without
    making any resistance: Ho shaou yuen alone
    opposed the banditti with a handful of people;
    but he at last fell fighting, and the pirates burnt<span class="sidenote">(21 v.)</span> four hundred shops and houses, and killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> about ten persons. After the pirates had retired,
    the inhabitants held in high esteem the
    excellent behaviour of Ho shaou yuen; they
    erected him a temple, and the deputy-governor
    Han fung performed sacrifices to his memory.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>Shaou yuen was commanding officer in the
    citadel of Lan shih; he was of an active spirit,
    and erected strong fences. Before the pirates
    arrived, this was his daily discourse when he
    spoke to the people: &quot;<i>I know that I shall be
    glorified this year by my death</i>.&quot; Half the year
    being already passed, it could not be seen how
    this prophecy was to be fulfilled. When the
    pirates came, he encouraged the citizens to oppose
    them vigorously; he himself girded on
    his sword and brandished his spear, and was
    the most forward in the battle. He killed many
    persons; but his strength failed him at last,
    and he was himself killed by the pirates. The
    villagers were greatly moved by his excellent
    behaviour; they erected him a temple, and said
    prayers before his effigy. It was then known
    what he meant, that &quot;he would be glorified in
    the course of the year.&quot; Now that twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> years are passed, they even honour him by exhibiting
    fire-works. I thought it proper to subjoin
    this remark to my history.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>On the twenty-seventh, Lin sun mustered
    about forty vessels, and went out to fight with
    the pirates in order to protect the water passage.
    He remained at Kin kang (which is near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> Shaou wan hae), hid himself westerly of that
    place the whole day, and removed then to Tsze<span class="sidenote">(22 r.)</span> ne. Chang paou ordered his vessels to remove to
    Shaou ting, and his men to go on shore in the
    night-time. Sun, seeing with sorrow that the
    pirates were so numerous, and that he could
    not make any effectual resistance, ran away
    eastwards and hid himself at Peih keang. At
    daylight the following morning the pirates
    sailed to Tsze ne to attack our commander, but
    not finding him, they stopped at Shaou ting;
    for this being the time when the autumnal winds
    begin to blow, they were afraid of them, and made
    preparations to retire. But we shall soon find
    the different flags returning to the high sea to
    fight both with extraordinary courage and great
    ferocity.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">1809. (22 v.)</div>
<p>On the twenty-ninth they returned to plunder
    Kan shin; they went into the river with small
    vessels, and the inhabitants opposing them,
    wounded two pirates, which all the pirates resented.
    They next came with large vessels, surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> the village, and made preparations to
    mount the narrow passes. The inhabitants remained
    within the intrenchments, and dared
    not come forward. The pirates then divided
    their force according to the various passes, and
    made an attack. The inhabitants prepared
    themselves to make a strong resistance near the
    entrance from the sea on the east side of the
    fence; but the pirates stormed the fence, planted
    their flag on the shore, and then the whole
    squadron followed. The inhabitants fought
    bravely, and made a dreadful slaughter when
    the pirates crossed the entrance at Lin tow.
    The boxing-master, Wei tang chow, made a vigorous
    resistance, and killed about ten pirates.
    The pirates then began to withdraw, but Chang
    paou himself headed the battle, which lasted
    very long. The inhabitants were not strong
    enough. Wei tang was surrounded by the pirates;<span class="sidenote">(24 r.)</span> nevertheless that his wife fought valiantly by
    his side. On seeing that they were surrounded
    and exhausted, the father of the lady<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> forward and killed some pirates. The pirates
    then retired in opposite directions, in order to
    surround their opponents in such a manner that
    they might not escape, and could be killed
    without being able to make any resistance; and
    thus it happened, the wife of Wei tang being
    slain with the others.</p>
<p>The pirates now pursued the inhabitants of
    the place, who cut the bridge and retired to the
    neighbouring hills. The pirates swam through
    the water and attacked the inhabitants, who
    were unable to escape. The whole force of the
    pirates being now on shore, the inhabitants suffered
    a severe loss,&mdash;it is supposed about a
    hundred of them were killed; the loss of the
    pirates also was considerable.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809. (23 v.)</div>
<p>The pirates went in four divisions to plunder;
    they took here an immense quantity of clothes
    and other goods, and carried away one thousand
    one hundred and forty captives of both
    sexes. They set on fire about ten houses; the
    flames could not be extinguished for some
    days; in the whole village you could not hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> the cry of a dog or a hen. The other inhabitants
    retired far from the village, or hid
    themselves in the fields. In the paddy fields
    about a hundred women were hidden, but the
    pirates on hearing a child crying, went to the
    place and carried them away. <i>Mei ying</i>, the
    wife of Ke choo yang, was very beautiful, and a
    pirate being about to seize her by the head, she
    abused him exceedingly. The pirate bound her
    to the yard-arm; but on abusing him yet more,
    the pirate dragged her down and broke two of
    her teeth, which filled her mouth and jaws with
    blood. The pirate sprang up again to bind her.
    Ying allowed him to approach, but as soon as he
    came near her, she laid hold of his garments with
    her bleeding mouth, and threw both him and
    herself into the river, where they were drowned,
    The remaining captives of both sexes were after
    some months liberated, on having paid a ransom
    of fifteen thousand leang or ounces of silver.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>Travelling once to Pwan pÃ«en jow I was
    affected by the virtuous behaviour of <i>Mei ying</i>,
    and all generous men will, as I suppose, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> moved by the same feelings. I therefore composed
    a song, mourning her fate:</p>

<h2><a name="BOOK_SECOND" id="BOOK_SECOND">BOOK SECOND.</a></h2>
<div class="sidenote">1809. (1 r.)</div>
<p>On the thirteenth day of the ninth moon our
    Admiral Tsuen mow sun mustered about eighty
    vessels to go to Shaou wan, and obstruct the
    passage. The pirates heard of these preparations,
    and on the night of the fourteenth every
    vessel of the different flags was ordered to go
    to Shaou wan. Their order was, that being
    within ten le from the place, they should stop
    and prepare themselves to begin the battle
    when it was dark. From the first night watch
    the cannon began to fire, and only ceased with<span class="sidenote">(1 v.)</span> daylight. At the end of the day the cannon
    were again roaring without any intermission, and
    the country people mounted on the green Lo
    shang, to look at the progress of the fight.
    They saw the wrecks of vessels floating on the
    sea, the waves were rolling, the bullets flying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> and the cries of dying people mounted to
    the skies. The vallies re-echoed the noise;
    beasts and birds<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> started alarmed, and found
    no place where they might repose themselves.
    The vessels were thrown into disorder, and our
    army was pressed down by the overpowering
    force of the enemy. Our commander lost four
    vessels, but the palisade before the village
    could not be taken, by which means it was
    protected against pillage. Our admiral said,
    &quot;Since I cannot conquer these wicked pirates,
    I will blow myself up.&quot; In this manner the<span class="sidenote">(2 r.)</span> admiral and many other officers met their death.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>On the twenty-fifth the pirates went to HÃ«ang
    shan and to great Hwang po;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> they took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> possession of the inside and the outside passage of
    Hwang po, so that the boat-people,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> who stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> outside on the coast, retired and came up to
    the town with their boats. The military officer
    Ting gaou ho being made acquainted with the
    arrival of the pirates, requested ten fishing
    boats from the town HÃ«ang shan to assist the
    citizens and to help them in opposing the
    enemy. He posted himself before the town to
    protect it. Ting gaou behaved valiantly on the
    river; he headed his small fleet of fishing boats
    and opposed the pirates. There was incessant<span class="sidenote">(2 v.)</span> fighting day and night; but at last the numerous
    vessels of the pirates surrounded him on
    all sides, and Ting gaou ho received a severe
    wound in the back. He then addressed his
    comrades in the following words:</p>
<p class="blockquot">&quot;Being on<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a> the military station before this town, it was my
    intention to destroy the pirates, and for this
    reason I united with all the principal men to
    oppose them, without considering my own
    safety;&mdash;joyful I went to oppose the enemy.
    But not being able to destroy this immense number
    of banditti, I am now surrounded with all
    my principal men; and being deficient in
    power, I will die. Death could not move me,
    but I fear the cruel behaviour of the banditti;
    I fear that if the battle come to its highest
    summit, our fathers and mothers, our wives and
    sons, will be taken captives. United with the
    principal men of the town, we cannot destroy
    the pirates, neither protect the country, our(3 r.) families, nor our own firesides,&mdash;but the circumstances
    being desperate, we must do our
    utmost.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>They now again rushed against the pirates
    and killed many of them; but their strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> being exhausted, the ten fishing boats were
    taken, and great Hwang po given up to be plundered.
    The citizens retired to their intrenchments,
    and made such vigorous resistance that
    the pirates could not make them captives.
    Chang paou therefore ordered O po tae and Leang
    po paou to make an attack on both sides, on the
    front and the rear at once; so the citizens sustained
    a great defeat, and about a hundred of
    them were killed. A placard was then posted
    up in the town, admonishing the citizens that
    they being unable to resist the enemy, must,
    under these cruel circumstances, send messengers
    to make terms with the pirates. This<span class="sidenote">(3 v.)</span> being done, the pirates withdrew.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>The wife of Ching yih then ordered the pirates
    to go up the river; she herself remaining with
    the larger vessels in the sea to blockade the
    different harbours or entrances from the sea-side;
    but the government officers made preparations
    to oppose her. There were about this
    time three foreign vessels returning to Portugal.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> Y&#301;h's wife attacked them, took one vessel, and
    killed about ten of the foreigners; the two
    other vessels escaped. The Major Pang noo of
    HÃ«ang shan about this time fitted out a hundred
    vessels to attack the pirates; he had before
    hired six foreign vessels, and the two Portuguese
    ships, which had before run away, united also
    with him. Y&#301;h's wife, seeing that she had not
    vessels enough, and that she might be surrounded,
    ordered a greater number to her assistance.<span class="sidenote">(4 r.)</span> She appointed Chang paou to command them,
    and sail up the river; but to keep quiet with
    his squadron till he saw the Chang lung, or
    government vessels come on. On the third of
    the tenth moon the government vessels went
    higher up the river, and Chang paou following
    and attacking them, the foreign vessels sustained
    a great loss, and all the other vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> then ran away. The foreigners showed themselves
    very courageous; they petitioned the
    mayor of HÃ«ang shan to place himself at the
    head of the foreign vessels, to go and fight the
    pirates. Pang noo having for some time considered
    their request, inspected on the tenth of
    the same month the six foreign vessels, their
    arms and provisions, and went out into the sea<span class="sidenote">(4 v.)</span> to pursue the pirates.</p>
<p>About this time Chang paou had collected his
    force at Ta yu shan near Chih leih ke&#335;, and the
    foreign vessels went thither to attack him.
    About the same time the admiral, Tsuen mow
    sun, collected a hundred vessels, and joined the
    foreigners to attack the pirates. On the thirteenth
    they spread out their lines, and fought
    during two days and two nights, without either
    party proving victorious. On the fifteenth one
    of the officers went forward with some large
    vessels to attack the pirates, but he was very
    much hurt by the fire of the guns; his vessel
    was lost, and about ten men were killed and
    many others wounded,&mdash;after this, the whole
    fleet retired. They however again commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> fighting on the sixteenth, but being unable to
    withstand the pirates, one vessel more was
    lost.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<div class="sidenote">(5 r.)</div>
<div class="sidenote">(5 v.)</div>
<p>The Admiral Tsuen mow sun was exceedingly
    eager to destroy the pirates, but he was
    confident that he was not strong enough to vanquish
    them, and he spoke thus to his people:
    &quot;The pirates are too powerful, we cannot master
    them by our arms; the pirates are many, we
    only few; the pirates have large vessels, we only
    small ones; the pirates are united under one
    head, but we are divided,&mdash;and we alone are
    unable to engage with this overpowering force.
    We must therefore now make an attack, when
    they cannot avail themselves of their number,
    and contrive something besides physical strength,
    for by this alone it is impossible for us to be victorious.
    The pirates are now all assembled in
    Ta yu shan, a place which is surrounded by
    water. Relying on their strength, and thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> that they will be able to vanquish us, they will
    certainly not leave this place of retirement. We
    should therefore from the provincial city (Canton)
    assemble arms and soldiers as many as we can,
    surround the place, and send fire-vessels among
    their fleet. It is probable that in such a manner
    we may be able to measure our strength with
    them.&quot;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>In consequence of this determination all
    commanders and officers of the different vessels
    were ordered to meet on the seventeenth at Chih
    leih ke&#335;, to blockade the pirates in Ta yu shan,
    and to cut off all supplies of provisions that
    might be sent to them. To annoy them yet
    more, the officers were ordered to prepare the
    materials for the fire-vessels. These fire-vessels
    were filled with gunpowder, nitre, and other
    combustibles; after being filled, they were set on<span class="sidenote">(6 r.)</span> fire by a match from the stern, and were instantly
    all in a blaze. The Major of HÃ«ang shan, Pang
    noo, asked permission to bring soldiers with him,
    in order that they might go on shore and make
    an attack under the sound of martial music,
    during the time the mariners made their preparation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> On the twentieth it began to blow very
    fresh from the north, and the commander ordered
    twenty fire-vessels to be sent off, when they took,
    driven by the wind, an easterly direction; but
    the pirate's entrenchments being protected by a
    mountain, the wind ceased, and they could not
    move farther on in that direction; they turned
    about and set on fire two men of war. The
    pirates knowing our design were well prepared
    for it; they had bars with very long pincers, by
    which they took hold of the fire-vessels and kept
    them off, so that they could not come near.
    Our commander, however, would not leave the
    place; and being very eager to fight, he ordered<span class="sidenote">(6 v.)</span> that an attack should be made, and it is presumed
    that about three hundred pirates were
    killed. Pao now began to be afraid, and asked
    the <i>Spirit of the three Po</i>, or old mothers, to give
    a prognostic. The <i>P&#259;h</i>, or lot for fighting, was
    disastrous; the <i>P&#259;h</i>, or lot to remain in the
    easterly entrenchment, was to be happy. The <i>P&#259;h</i>, or lot for knowing if he might force the
    blockade or not on leaving his station to-morrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> was also happy,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> three times one after
    another.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>There arose with the day-light on the twenty-second
    a light southerly breeze; all the squadrons
    began to move, and the pirates prepared
    themselves joyfully to leave their station.
    About noon<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> there was a strong southerly
    wind, and a very rough sea on. As soon as it
    became dark the pirates made sail, with a good
    deal of noise, and broke through the blockade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> favoured by the southerly wind. About a hundred
    vessels were upset, when the pirates left
    Ta yu shan. But our commander being unaware
    that the pirates would leave their entrenchments,
    was not prepared to withstand
    them. The foreign vessels fired their guns and<span class="sidenote">(7 r.)</span> surrounded about ten leaky vessels, but could
    not hurt the pirates themselves; the pirates left
    the leaky vessels behind and ran away. After
    this they assembled outside at Hung chow in
    the ocean.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>Notwithstanding that the pirates had broken
    through the blockade, Tsuen mow sun desisted
    not from pursuing them; he followed the pirates
    into the open sea in order to attack them. On
    the fifth of the eleventh moon he met the pirates
    near Nan gaou, and prepared his vessels<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> to
    attack them. The pirates spread out all their
    vessels one by one, so that the line of their fleet
    reached the forces of our commander; they then
    tried to form a circle and surround our admiral.
    Our commander, in order to prevent this, divided<span class="sidenote">(7 v.)</span> his force,&mdash;he separated from him eighty vessels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> which had orders to join him afterwards. Before
    they united again, a great battle took place
    between the two fleets; the firing lasted from
    three till five in the afternoon; our crew fought
    exceedingly hard and burnt three pirate-vessels.
    The pirates retreated, and our navy declined
    pursuing them, because it would carry them
    too far out of the way. Our crew being still
    elated at this transaction, the pirates on a
    sudden returned, roused them out of their sleep
    and constrained them to fight a second time.
    The commander had no time to make preparations,
    so that two vessels were burnt by the
    fire of the pirates, and three were captured.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809. (8 r.)</div>
<p>At the time when Chang paou was blockaded
    in Chih leih ke&#335;, and was afraid that he should
    not be able to come out again, he sent to O po
    tae, who was at Wei chow, to rescue him. His
    message was in the following words:&mdash;&quot;I am
    harassed by the government's officers outside in
    the sea; lips and teeth must help one another,
    if the lips are cut away the teeth will feel cold.
    How shall I alone be able to fight the government
    forces? You should therefore come at the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> of your crew, to attack the government squadron
    in the rear, I will then come out of my station
    and make an attack in front; the enemy being
    so taken in the front and rear, will, even supposing
    we cannot master him, certainly be
    thrown into disorder.&quot;</p>
<p>Ever since the time Paou was made chieftain
    there had been altercations between him and O
    po tae. Had it not have been out of respect for
    the wife of Ching y&#301;h they would perhaps have<span class="sidenote">(8v.)</span> made war against each other. Till now they
    only showed their mutual dislike in their plundering
    expeditions on the ocean, and in consequence
    of this jealousy Po tae did not fulfil the
    orders of Paou. Paou and his whole crew felt
    very much annoyed at this conduct, and having
    been able to break through the blockade, he
    resolved to measure his strength with Tae. He
    met him at Neaou chow, and asked him: &quot;Why
    did you not come to my assistance?&quot;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>O po tae answered: &quot;You must first consider
    your strength and then act; you must consider
    the business and then go to work. How could
    I and my crew have been sufficient against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> forces of the admiral. I learnt your request,
    but men being dependent upon circumstances,
    I could not fulfil it; I learnt your request, but
    I was dependent on circumstances, and men<span class="sidenote">(9 r.)</span> cannot act otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> And now concerning
    this business&mdash;to give or not give assistance&mdash;am
    I bound to come and join your forces?&quot;</p>
<p>Paou became enraged and said: &quot;How is
    this, will you then separate from us?&quot;</p>
<p>Tae answered: &quot;I will not separate myself.&quot;</p>
<p>Paou: &quot;Why then do you not obey the
    orders of the wife of Ching y&#301;h and my
    own? What is this else than separation, that
    you do not come to assist me, when I am surrounded
    by the enemy? I have sworn it that I
    will destroy thee, wicked man, that I may do
    away with this soreness on my back.&quot;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>There passed many other angry words between
    them, till they at length prepared to fight
    and destroy each other. Chang paou was the
    first to begin the battle; but having fired his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> guns, and being deficient in strength, Tae went
    against him with all his well prepared forces.
    Paou was not able to make any effectual resistance
    to his enemy; he received a severe defeat,
    he lost sixteen vessels, and three hundred men<span class="sidenote">(9 v.)</span> were taken prisoners. The prisoners were all
    killed from mutual hatred.</p>
<p>O po tae remained then at the head of his
    forces without any opposition, since Paou withdrew.
    There was now a meeting held under
    these banditti; when Chang jih kao arose and
    said:</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>&quot;If Paou and we should again measure our
    strength against each other, our force will not be
    found sufficient; we are only one to ten. It is
    to be feared that they will collect all their forces
    together to exterminate us. They may on a
    sudden come against us and make an attack,&mdash;our
    small body must certainly be in fear of their
    vast number. There is <i>Leang po paou</i>, an experienced
    pirate on the sea; if he should on
    a sudden turn his vessels against us, there is not
    one among us who would be able to resist him.
    He is a very zealous worshipper of the spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> the three Po or Mothers, and protected by
    them; nay, and protected by them in a supernatural
    manner. But if we perform sacrifices,<span class="sidenote">(10 r.)</span> they remain without shadow and echo.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> And
    then it may also be added that we are no more
    able to withstand with our short arms their long
    ones, than dogs are able to chase fierce tigers.
    But do we not every where see government
    placards inviting us to submit, why do we not
    then send somebody to make the offer? The
    government will pardon and not destroy us
    sea-monsters,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and we may then reform our
    previous conduct. Why should we not therefore
    come to a determination to that effect?&quot;</p>
<p>Fung yung fa said: &quot;How then if government
    should not trust our word?&quot;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>Chang jih kao answered: &quot;If government
    should learn that we recently fought Chang<span class="sidenote">(10 v.)</span> paou, and destroyed the banditti,&mdash;it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> be hard indeed if that were not enough to make
    them trust us?&quot;</p>
<p>Go tsew he said: &quot;If government should not
    act towards us, as it is stated in the placard,
    after having made our submission, we may then
    again use violence. But they will hear, that we
    attacked the others, like fishes their food; that
    we alone made a beginning in destroying the
    pirates, and then tendered our submission,&mdash;they
    will feel that they can employ us to destroy
    the other pirates. He who is not of the same
    opinion as mine may let his hand hang down.&quot;</p>
<p>O po tae was of the same opinion, and the
    purser was ordered to frame the offer of submission
    to government. The petition concerning
    the offer was couched in the following terms:</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p class="blockquot">&quot;It is my humble opinion that all robbers of
    an overpowering force, whether they had their
    origin from this or any other cause, have felt the<span class="sidenote">(11 r.)</span> humanity of government at different times.
    Leang shan who three times plundered the city,
    was nevertheless pardoned and at last made a
    minister of state.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Wa kang often challenged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> the arms of his country and was suffered to live,
    and at last made a corner-stone of the empire.
    Joo ming pardoned seven times Mang hw&#335;; and
    Kwan kung three times set Tsaou tsaou at
    liberty.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Ma yuen pursued not the exhausted
    robbers; and Y&#335; fei killed not those who made
    their submission. There are many other instances
    of such transactions both in former and
    recent times, by which the country was strengthened
    and government increased its power. We<span class="sidenote">(11 v.)</span> now live in a very populous age; some of us
    could not agree with their relations, and were
    driven out like noxious weeds. Some after having
    tried all they could, without being able to provide
    for themselves, at last joined bad society.
    Some lost their property by shipwrecks; some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> withdrew into this watery empire to escape from
    punishment. In such a way those, who in the
    beginning were only three or five, were in the
    course of time increased to a thousand or ten
    thousand, and so it went on increasing every
    year. Would it not have been wonderful if
    such a multitude, being in want of their daily
    bread, should not have resorted to plunder and
    robbery to gain their subsistence, since they
    could not in any other manner be saved from
    famine? It was from necessity that the laws
    of the empire were violated, and the merchants
    robbed of their goods. Being deprived of our
    land and of our native places, having no house
    or home to resort to, and relying only on the<span class="sidenote">(12 r.)</span> chances of wind and water, even could we for
    a moment forget our griefs, we might fall in
    with a man-of-war, who with stones, darts
    and guns, would blow out our brains.</p>
<p class="blockquot">&quot;Even
    if we dared to sail up a stream and boldly go
    on with anxiety of mind under wind, rain, and
    stormy weather, we must every where prepare
    for fighting. Whether we went to the east, or to
    the west, and after having felt all the hardships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> of the sea, the night dew was our only dwelling,
    and the rude wind our meal. But now we
    will avoid these perils, leave our connexions,
    and desert our comrades; we will make our
    submission. The power of government knows
    no bounds; it reaches to the islands in the sea,
    and every man is afraid and sighs. Oh we
    must be destroyed by our crimes, none can
    escape who opposeth the laws of government.
    May you then feel compassion for those who<span class="sidenote">(12 v.)</span> are deserving of death; may you sustain us by
    your humanity!&quot;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>The chief officers of government met joyfully
    together at Canton. The governor-general of the
    southern district ever loved the people like himself;
    and to show his benevolence he often invited
    them by public placards to make submission:&mdash;he
    really felt compassion for these lower sort of
    men, who were polluted with crimes. The way
    of compassion and benevolence is the way of
    heaven, which is pleased with virtue; it is the
    right way to govern by righteousness. Can the
    bird remain quiet with strong wings, or will the
    fish not move in deep water? Every person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> acts from natural endowments, and our general
    would have felt compassion even for the meanest
    creature on earth, if they would have asked
    for pardon. He therefore redeemed these pirates
    from destruction, and pardoned their former
    crimes.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>
<p>After this period the country began to assume
    a new appearance. People sold their arms and<span class="sidenote">(13 r.)</span> bought oxen to plough their fields; they burned
    sacrifices, said prayers on the top of the hills, and
    rejoiced themselves by singing behind screens
    during day-time. There were some people who
    endeavoured to act with duplicity, and wished
    to murder the pirates, but the general on seeing
    the petition said to his assistants: &quot;I will pull
    down the vanguard of the enemy to use it for
    the destruction of the remaining part. I may
    then employ it against the over-spreading power
    of the pirates; with the pirates I will destroy the
    pirates. Y&#335; fu mow destroyed in this manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> Yang tay: let us not act with duplicity, that we
    may the better disperse their comrades and
    break their power; let us therefore accept their
    submission.&quot;</p>
<div class="sidenote">Jan.
    1810.</div>
<p>In the agreement it was stipulated that the
    ships should assemble together in the open sea
    near Kwei shen hÃ«en<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> to make their surrender.
    The Governor-general was to come to that place<span class="sidenote">(13 v.)</span> to receive O po tae, his vessels, his men, and
    all other things which were pointed out in the
    petition. The Governor-general being exceedingly
    pleased, ordered his adjutant Kung gaou
    to examine the list. He found eight thousand
    men, one hundred and twenty-six vessels, five
    hundred large guns, and five thousand six hundred
    various military weapons. The towns Yang
    keang and Sin gan were appointed for this
    people to live in.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>&mdash;This happened in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> twelfth month of the fourteenth year of KÃ«a
    king&mdash;and so the black squadron was brought
    into subjection. O po tae changed his name to <i>He&#335; bÃ«en</i>, &quot;The lustre of instruction,&quot; and the
    general made him a Pa tsung<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> to reward his
    services in defeating Chang paou.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1810. (14 r.)</div>
<p>On the twelfth moon Chang paou went with
    his different squadrons into the river and attacked
    Ke chow. It was near the end of the year,
    and the pirates assembled along the mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> ridge Laou ya<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> to make a festival: they made
    a great noise during the night with crackers,
    and their gongs were heard at a great distance.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> At daybreak the flags were spread out, and the
    drums sounded; they were cheerful the whole
    day; they eat and drank and made a great
    noise, which was heard many les off.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>
<p>On the second day of the same month they
    attacked the village, and on the third day about
    ten men went on shore. The villagers made
    their escape, so that the pirates could not take
    them. Having some time before made preparations
    to fortify Ma king yun.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> they now retired
    to it. The pirates knowing that the villagers
    were well provided for defence, waited until<span class="sidenote">(14 v.)</span> they had every thing ready. On the fourth
    the pirates landed; it was in vain that the
    villagers opposed them, they had two men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> wounded, and were finally defeated. The Governor-general
    ordered Ching chuy loo to proceed
    at the head of a large body of soldiers to
    the town Shun tih, and prepare for an attack.
    Meeting the pirates at Ke chow, the Major
    attacking them on a sudden, the pirates sustained
    a great loss, and returned to their vessels.
    The Major also was struck by a shot from a
    musket. There were daily skirmishes at the
    neighbouring places; the inhabitants were generally
    defeated and ran away. The Major
    Loo came with his forces and placed them on
    the sea-coast behind the intrenchments of Sin
    ne, to protect them against the fire of the
    enemy. The guns of the pirates were directed
    against the place, the bullets fell in Sin ne, but
    without hurting any one, which again calmed
    and encouraged the inhabitants. The pirates<span class="sidenote">(15 r.)</span> coming a second time before Ke chow and Ta
    leang, and not being able to accomplish their
    designs, thought fit to retire.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>
<p>The wife of Ching y&#301;h, on seeing that O po tae
    was made a government officer after his submission,
    and that he did well, thought also of making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> her submission. &quot;I am,&quot; said she, &quot;ten times
    stronger than O po tae, and government would
    perhaps, if I submit, act towards me as they did
    with O po tae.&quot; But remembering their former
    crimes, and the opposition they made to many
    officers, these pirates were apprehensive and felt
    undetermined in their resolutions. A rumour<span class="sidenote">(15 v.)</span> went about, that the red squadron wished to
    tender their submission, and, in consequence, the
    vigilant magistrates hearing of this, invited them
    to do so. The magistrate of Tsze ne, Yu che
    chang, ordered a certain Fei hÃ«ung chow to
    make enquiries about the matter. Fei hÃ«ung
    chow was a physician of Macao, and being well
    acquainted with the pirates, he was not in need
    of any introduction to obtain access to them.
    This was the ground on which Yu chi chang
    particularly selected him, when he tried to bring
    the pirates to submission.</p>
<p>When Fei hÃ«ung chow came to Paou, he said:
    &quot;Friend Paou, do you know why I come to you?&quot;</p>
<p>Paou.&mdash;&quot;Thou hast committed some crime
    and comest to me for protection?&quot;</p>
<p>Chow.&mdash;&quot;By no means.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>
<p>Paou.&mdash;&quot;You will then know, how it stands
    concerning the report about our submission, if it
    is true or false?&quot;</p>
<p>Chow.&mdash;&quot;You are again wrong here, Sir.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> What are you in comparison with O po tae?&quot;</p>
<p>Paou.&mdash;&quot;Who is bold enough to compare me<span class="sidenote">(16 r.)</span> with O po tae?&quot;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>
<p>Chow.&mdash;&quot;I know very well that O po tae
    could not come up to you, Sir; but I mean only,
    that since O po tae has made his submission,
    since he has got his pardon and been created a
    government officer,&mdash;how would it be, if you
    with your whole crew should also submit, and if
    his Excellency should desire to treat you in the
    same manner, and to give you the same rank as
    O po tae? Your submission would produce
    more joy to government than the submission of
    O po tae. You should not wait for wisdom to
    act wisely; you should make up your mind to
    submit to the government with all your followers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> I will assist you in every respect,&mdash;it would be
    the means of securing your own happiness and
    the lives of all your adherents.&quot;</p>
<p><i>Chang paou</i> remained like a statue without
    motion, and Fei hÃ«ung chow went on to say:<span class="sidenote">(16 v.)</span> &quot;You should think about this affair in time,
    and not stay till the last moment. Is it not
    clear that O po tae, since you could not agree
    together, has joined government. He being
    enraged against you, will fight, united with the
    forces of the government, for your destruction;
    and who could help you, so that you might
    overcome your enemies? If O po tae could
    before vanquish you quite alone, how much
    more can he now when he is united with government?
    O po tae will then satisfy his hatred
    against you, and you yourself will soon be taken
    either at Wei chow or at Neaou chow. If the
    merchant-vessels of Hwy chaou, the boats of
    Kwang chow, and all the fishing-vessels unite<span class="sidenote">(17 r.)</span> together to surround and attack you in the open
    sea, you will certainly have enough to do. But
    even supposing they should not attack you, you
    will soon feel the want of provisions, to sustain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> you and all your followers. It is always wisdom
    to provide before things happen; stupidity and
    folly never think about future events. It is too
    late to reflect upon events when things have
    happened; you should, therefore, consider this
    matter in time!&quot;</p>
<p>Paou held a deliberation with the wife of
    Ching y&#301;h, and she said: &quot;The Doctor Chow
    is certainly right in all that he says; Paou may
    agree with him.&quot; Paou then asked the Doctor:
    &quot;Have you any commission about this matter,
    or not?&quot; The Doctor answered, &quot;How could
    I trifle with the sentiments of government; this
    would be declared an improper behaviour.<span class="sidenote">(17 v.)</span> Neither can I see through the intentions of
    the wife of Ching y&#301;h nor through those of the
    officers of government; you can clear up all
    doubts, if you will collect your vessels about
    Shao kÃ«&#335;, outside the Bocca Tigris, you may
    yourself hear the orders.&quot;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>
<p>Paou consented to this proposal, and the Doctor
    returned to Yu che chang. Yu che chang acquainted
    the Governor-general with this matter.
    The general was anxious to meet the pirates and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> to clear the western passage, as he had already
    cleared the eastern passage; he therefore was
    very happy at hearing the offer of surrender.
    The magistrate of Tsze ne, Yu che chang, took
    the government proclamation and went to the
    pirates to see how things stood. The wife of
    Ching y&#301;h on seeing Yu che chang, ordered
    Chang paou to prepare a banquet. Chang paou
    explained his intentions. Yu che chang remained
    the whole night on board ship, and
    stated that government was willing to pardon<span class="sidenote">(18 r.)</span> them, and that they had nothing to fear after
    having made their submission. Paou was very
    much rejoiced at this; and on the next morning
    he went with Yu che chang to inspect the vessels,
    and ordered all the captains to pay their
    respects to the government officer. The wife of
    Ching y&#301;h stated to Yu che chang that it was
    her earnest wish to submit to government; and
    Chang paou himself assured the officer of his firm
    intention to surrender without the least deceit.
    The governor then ordered Yu che chang to visit
    the pirates a second time, accompanied by Pang
    noo, in order to settle all with them regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> their submission. Chang paou requested that
    those pirates who had been condemned to death
    should be placed in ten vessels, in order that he
    might ransom them. Yu che chang reported
    this, and the Governor said: &quot;It shall be so,
    whether Chang paou submit himself or not.
    But being exceedingly desirous that the pirates
    may surrender, I will go myself and state my
    intentions, to clear up all doubts.&quot;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>
<p>He ordered the Doctor Fei hÃ«ung chow to acquaint
    the pirates with his design. The Governor-general<span class="sidenote">(18 v.)</span> then embarked in a vessel with
    Pang noo and Yu che chang to meet the pirates,
    where they were assembled;&mdash;their vessels occupied
    a space of about ten le. On hearing
    that the Governor-general was coming, they
    hoisted their flags, played on their instruments,
    and fired their guns, so that the smoke rose in
    clouds, and then went to meet him. From the
    other side the people all became alarmed, and
    the Governor-general himself was very much
    astonished, being yet uncertain what could be the
    meaning of all this alarm. Chang paou, accompanied
    by the wife of Ching y&#301;h, by Pang chang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> ching, Leang po paou, and Soo puh gaou, mounted
    the governor's ship, and rushed through the smoke
    to the place where the governor was stationed.
    The Governor-general on seeing Paou and his
    followers falling on their hands and knees, that<span class="sidenote">(19 r.)</span> they shed tears on account of their former
    crimes, and sued penitently for their lives, was
    induced by his extreme kindness to declare
    that he would again point out to the rebels the
    road to virtue. Paou and his followers were
    extremely affected, knocked their heads on the
    ground, and swore that they were ready to suffer
    death. But the Governor replied: &quot;Since
    you are ready to submit yourselves with a true
    heart, I will lay aside all arms and disperse
    the soldiery; to say it in one word, I give you
    three days to make up a list of your vessels and
    all your other possessions. Are you satisfied
    with this proposal or not?&quot; Paou and his followers
    said &quot;<i>yes, yes</i>,&quot; and retired accordingly.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>
<p>It happened that about the same time some
    Portuguese vessels were about to enter the
    Bocca Tigris, and that some large men-of-war
    took their station at the same place. The pirates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> became exceedingly alarmed at this fleet, and
    apprehended that the Governor had made an
    agreement with the foreign vessels to destroy
    them. They immediately weighed their anchors
    and steered away. On seeing the pirates running<span class="sidenote">(19 v.)</span> away, Pang noo, Yu che chang, and the
    others, not knowing what could be the reason of
    all this, became afraid that they might have
    changed their mind, and that an attack on the
    Governor was contemplated. All parties became
    frightened that the meeting had failed, and made
    preparations to go off. The inhabitants of the
    neighbouring country hearing of this, ran away,
    and the Governor-general himself went back to
    Canton.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>
<p>When the pirates ascertained that the foreign
    vessels were traders going into the river, and
    that the Governor-general had no communication
    with them, they again became pacified. But
    considering that the Governor-general went back
    to Canton without the business of their submission
    being quite settled, they held a consultation
    together and Paou said: &quot;His Excellency
    is gone back, and probably in doubt about our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> intentions; if we tender our submission again,<span class="sidenote">(20 r.)</span> his Excellency will not trust us, and if we do
    not submit we shall insult the good intentions of
    government. What is to be done under these
    circumstances?&quot;</p>
<p>The wife of Ching y&#301;h said: &quot;His Excellency
    behaved himself towards us in a candid manner,
    and in like manner we must behave towards
    him. We being driven about on the ocean,
    without having any fixed habitation;&mdash;pray let
    us go to Canton to inform government, to state
    the reason of the recoiling waves, to clear up all
    doubts, and to agree on what day or in what
    place we shall make our submission. His Excellency
    may then explain to us whether he will
    come a second time to accept our submission,
    or whether he will decline it.&quot;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>
<p>The whole crew was of opinion, that &quot;the
    designs of government were unfathomable, and
    that it would not be prudent to go so hastily on.&quot;
    But the wife of Ching y&#301;h replied: &quot;If his<span class="sidenote">(20 v.)</span> Excellency, a man of the highest rank, could
    come quickly to us quite alone, why should I a
    mean woman not go to the officers of government?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> If there be any danger in it, I will take
    it on myself, no person among you will be required
    to trouble himself about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Leang po paou said: &quot;If the wife of Ching
    y&#301;h goes, we must fix a time when she shall
    return. If this time be past without our obtaining
    any certain information, we should collect
    all our forces and go before Canton.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> This
    is my opinion; if you think otherwise, let us retire;
    but let me hear your opinion?&quot; They all
    answered: &quot;Friend Paou, we have heard thy
    opinion, but we think it rather better to wait for
    the news here on the water, than to send the
    wife of Ching y&#301;h alone to be killed.&quot; This was
    the result of the consultation.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1810. (21 r.)</div>
<p>Yu che chang and Fei hÃ«ung chow, on seeing
    that nothing was settled about the submission
    to government, became alarmed, and sent Chao
    kaou yuen to Chang paou to enquire what was
    the reason of it. On learning that they ran
    away from fear of the foreign vessels, Yu che
    chang and Fei hÃ«ung chow made another visit to
    the pirates, in order to correct this mistake.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p>&quot;If you let slip this opportunity,&quot; said they,
    &quot;you will not be accepted, perhaps, should
    you even be willing to make your submission.
    The kindness of his Excellency is immense like
    the sea, without being mixed with any falsehood;
    we will pledge ourselves that the wife of
    Ching y&#301;h, if she would go, would be received
    with kindness.&quot;</p>
<p>The wife of Ching y&#301;h said: &quot;You speak
    well, gentlemen; I will go myself to Canton
    with some other ladies, accompanied by Yu che
    chang.&quot;</p>
<p>Chang paou said, laughingly: &quot;I am sorry his<span class="sidenote">(21 v.)</span> Excellency should have any doubt regarding us,
    for this reason, therefore, we will send our wives
    to settle the affair for us.&quot;</p>
<p>When the wives and children appeared before
    him, the Governor-general said to them: &quot;You
    did not change your mind, but ran away, being
    deceived by a false impression; for this reason
    I will take no notice of it. I am commanded
    by the humanity of his Majesty's government
    not to kill but to pardon you; I therefore now
    pardon Chang paou.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>
<p>In consequence of this, Chang paou came with
    his wives and children, and with the wife of Ching
    y&#301;h, at Foo yung shao near the town of HÃ«ang shan
    to submit himself to government. Every vessel
    was provided with pork and wine, and every
    man received at the same time a bill for a certain
    quantity of money. Those who wished it,
    could join the military force of government for
    pursuing the remaining pirates; and those who
    objected, dispersed and withdrew into the country.
    This is the manner by which the red squadron
    of the pirates was pacified.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1810. (22 r.)</div>
<p>After the submission of Chang paou, the Governor-general
    said: &quot;Now that we have cleared,
    both the eastern and the middle passage, we are
    ready to reduce the pirates of the western passage.
    He held a consultation about this matter
    with the deputy-governor Han fung, and then
    ordered the principal officer of the public granary,
    Mwan ching che, and the military commandant
    of Luy chow foo, Kang chow foo, and
    KÃ«ung chow foo, called Chuh url kang g&#301;h,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> proceed at the head of the forces and drive the
    pirates away. It was presumed that they would
    retire more westerly to Annam; a message was
    therefore sent to the king of that country to
    have ready an armed force to repulse the pirates,
    whenever they should appear on the rivers or
    on the mainland.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Chang paou was ordered on
    the vanguard.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>
<p>By the tenth day of the fourth moon the
    vessels and the crew were quite ready, and fell
    in on the twelfth of the same month with the
    yellow flag quite alone at Tse sing yang. Our
    commander valiantly attacked this squadron,
    and defeated it entirely. The captain Le tsung<span class="sidenote">(22 v.)</span> chaou, with three hundred and ninety of his
    people, were taken prisoners. Meeting a division
    of the green flag, consisting of ten pirate
    vessels, our commander attacked them. The
    pirates being afraid, ran away; but our commander
    pursued after and killed them. Those
    who were taken alive were beheaded.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>
<p>On the tenth day of the fifth moon the Governor-general
    went to Kaou chow to make preparations
    for fighting. Our commander pursued
    after the pirates with a great and strong body of
    troops; he met Neaou sh&#301;h url at Tan chow,
    and they fought a great battle. Neaou sh&#301;h url
    saw that he was not strong enough to withstand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> them, and tried to escape; but the Major, Fei
    teaou hwang,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> gave orders to surround the pirates.<span class="sidenote">(23 r.)</span> They fought from seven o'clock in the
    morning till one at noon, burnt ten vessels, and
    killed an immense number of the pirates. Neaou
    sh&#301;h url was so weakened that he could scarcely
    make any opposition. On perceiving this
    through the smoke, Chang paou mounted on a
    sudden the vessel of the pirate, and cried out:
    &quot;I Chang paou am come,&quot; and at the same moment
    he cut some pirates to pieces; the remainder
    were then hardly dealt with. Paou addressed
    himself in an angry tone to Neaou sh&#301;h url,
    and said: &quot;I advise you to submit, will you
    not follow my advice, what have you to say?&quot;
    Neaou sh&#301;h url was struck with amazement,
    and his courage left him. Leang po paou advanced
    and bound him, and the whole crew
    were then taken captives.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>
<p>Seeing that Neaou sh&#301;h url was taken, his
    elder brother Yew kwei would have run away
    in all haste; but the admirals Tung and Tsuen<span class="sidenote">(23 v.)</span> mow sun pursued, attacked, and took him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> prisoner. The government officers Kung gao
    and Hoo tso chaou took the younger brother of
    Neaou sh&#301;h url, called Mih yew keih, and all the
    others then made their submission. Not long
    after this the <i>Scourge of the eastern ocean</i> surrendered
    voluntarily, on finding himself unable
    to withstand; the <i>Frog's meal</i> withdrew to
    Luzon or Manilla. On the twentieth of the
    same month, the Governor-general came to
    Luy chow, and every officer was ordered to
    bring his prizes into the harbour or bay of
    Man ke. There were taken fighting five hundred
    pirates, men and women; three thousand
    four hundred and sixty made their submission;
    there were eighty-six vessels, two hundred and
    ninety-one guns, and one thousand three hundred
    and seventy-two pieces of various military
    weapons. The Governor-general ordered one
    of his officers to kill<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> the pirate Neaou sh&#301;h url
    with eight others outside the northern entrance
    of Hae k&#259;ng hÃ«en,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and to behead Hwang h&#335;<span class="sidenote">(24 r.)</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> with one hundred and nineteen of his followers.
    The <i>Scourge of the eastern sea</i> submitting himself
    voluntarily was not put to death.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>
<p>There was much talk concerning a man at
    Hae k&#259;ng hÃ«en, whose crime was of such a nature
    that it could not be overlooked. When
    this man was carried away to suffer death, his
    wife pressed him in her arms, and said with
    great demonstration of sorrow, &quot;Because thou
    didst not follow my words, it is even thus. I
    said before what is now come to pass, that thou
    fighting as a pirate against the officers of government
    would be taken and put to death. This
    fills my mind with sorrow. If thou hadst made
    thy submission like O po tae and Chang paou, thou<span class="sidenote">(24 v.)</span> wouldst have been pardoned like them; thou
    art now given up to the law, not by any power
    of man, but by the will of fate.&quot; Having
    finished these words, she cried exceedingly.
    The Governor-general was moved by these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> words, and commuted the punishment of that
    pirate into imprisonment.</p>
<p>In this manner the western passage was
    cleared from the green, yellow, and blue squadrons,
    and smaller divisions. The rest of the
    pirates, who remained about Hae k&#259;ng, at
    Hae fung, at Suy ke and H&#335; poo, were gradually
    destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The Governor-general ordered
    Chuh url kang g&#301;h and Mwan ching che
    to go with an armed force and sweep away
    those pirates, who hid themselves in the recesses
    of Wei chow and Neaou chow. And
    thus finished this meritorious act of the <i>Pacification
    of the pirates</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1810. (25 r.)</div>
<p>By an edict of the &quot;Son of Heaven,&quot; the
    Governor-general of Kwang tung and Kwang se<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> <i>Pih, ling</i> was recompensed for his merits. He
    was created a secondary guardian of the Prince,
    allowed to wear peacock's-feathers with two
    eyes, and favoured with an hereditary title.
    The services of the different officers and commanders
    were taken into consideration, and
    they received adequate recompenses. Chang
    paou was appointed to the rank of Major; Tung
    hae pa, or, the Scourge of the eastern sea, and
    all others, were pardoned, with the permission
    to retire wherever they wished. From that period
    till now ships pass and repass in tranquillity.
    All is quiet on the rivers, the four seas are tranquil,
    and people live in peace and plenty.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX">APPENDIX.</a></h2>
<p>The Translator supposing that the readers of the <i>History of the Chinese Pirates</i> might perhaps find it interesting
    to compare the account of the followers of <i>The
    wife of Ching y&#301;h</i>, drawn up by an European, with the
    statements of the non-official Chinese historian; he has
    therefore thought fit to subjoin a <i>Narrative of the captivity
    and treatment amongst the Ladrones</i>, written by
    Mr. Richard Glasspoole, of the Hon. Company's ship <i>Marquis of Ely</i>, and published in <i>Wilkinson's Travels to
    China</i>. The Translator in vain endeavoured to obtain
    another Narrative, regarding the Chinese pirates, which
    is said to be printed in an English periodical.</p>
<p class="center"><i>A brief Narrative of my captivity and treatment amongst
    the Ladrones.</i></p>
<p>On the 17th of September 1809, the Honourable
    Company's ship Marquis of Ely anchored under the
    Island of <i>Sam Chow</i>, in China, about twelve English
    miles from Macao, where I was ordered to proceed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> one of our cutters to procure a pilot, and also to land
    the purser with the packet. I left the ship at 5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> with seven men under my command, well armed. It
    blew a fresh gale from the N. E. We arrived at Macao
    at 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, where I delivered the packet to Mr. Roberts,
    and sent the men with the boat's-sails to sleep under
    the Company's Factory, and left the boat in charge of
    one of the Compradore's men; during the night the
    gale increased.&mdash;At half-past three in the morning I
    went to the beach, and found the boat on shore half-filled
    with water, in consequence of the man having left
    her. I called the people, and baled her out; found
    she was considerably damaged, and very leaky. At
    half-past 5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, the ebb-tide making, we left Macao
    with vegetables for the ship.</p>
<p>One of the Compradore's men who spoke English
    went with us for the purpose of piloting the ship to <i>Lintin</i>, as the Mandarines, in consequence of a late
    disturbance at Macao, would not grant chops for the
    regular pilots. I had every reason to expect the ship
    in the roads, as she was preparing to get under weigh
    when we left her; but on our rounding Cabaretta-Point,
    we saw her five or six miles to leeward, under
    weigh, standing on the starboard-tack: it was then
    blowing fresh at N. E. Bore up, and stood towards
    her; when about a cable's-length to windward of her,
    she tacked; we hauled our wind and stood after her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> A hard squall then coming on, with a strong tide and
    heavy swell against us, we drifted fast to leeward, and
    the weather being hazy, we soon lost sight of the ship.
    Struck our masts, and endeavoured to pull; finding
    our efforts useless, set a reefed foresail and mizen, and
    stood towards a country-ship at anchor under the land
    to leeward of Cabaretta-Point. When within a quarter
    of a mile of her she weighed and made sail, leaving
    us in a very critical situation, having no anchor, and
    drifting bodily on the rocks to leeward. Struck the
    masts: after four or five hours hard pulling, succeeded
    in clearing them.</p>
<p>At this time not a ship in sight; the weather clearing
    up, we saw a ship to leeward, hull down, shipped our
    masts, and made sail towards her; she proved to be
    the Honourable Company's ship Glatton. We made
    signals to her with our handkerchiefs at the mast-head,
    she unfortunately took no notice of them, but tacked
    and stood from us. Our situation was now truly distressing,
    night closing fast, with a threatening appearance,
    blowing fresh, with hard rain and a heavy sea;
    our boat very leaky, without a compass, anchor or provisions,
    and drifting fast on a lee-shore, surrounded
    with dangerous rocks, and inhabited by the most barbarous
    pirates. I close-reefed my sails, and kept tack
    and tack 'till day-light, when we were happy to find
    we had drifted very little to leeward of our situation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> the evening. The night was very dark, with constant
    hard squalls and heavy rain.</p>
<p>Tuesday the 19th no ships in sight. About ten
    o'clock in the morning it fell calm, with very hard rain
    and a heavy swell;&mdash;struck our masts and pulled, not
    being able to see the land, steered by the swell. When
    the weather broke up, found we had drifted several
    miles to leeward. During the calm a fresh breeze
    springing up, made sail, and endeavoured to reach the
    weather-shore, and anchor with six muskets we had
    lashed together for that purpose. Finding the boat
    made no way against the swell and tide, bore up for a
    bay to leeward, and anchored about one <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> close
    under the land in five or six fathoms water, blowing
    fresh, with hard rain.</p>
<p>Wednesday the 20th at day-light, supposing the
    flood-tide making, weighed and stood over to the weather-land,
    but found we were drifting fast to leeward.
    About ten o'clock perceived two Chinese boats steering
    for us. Bore up, and stood towards them, and made
    signals to induce them to come within hail; on nearing
    them, they bore up, and passed to leeward of the
    islands. The Chinese we had in the boat advised me
    to follow them, and he would take us to Macao by the
    leeward passage. I expressed my fears of being taken
    by the Ladrones. Our ammunition being wet, and the
    muskets rendered useless, we had nothing to defend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> ourselves with but cutlasses, and in too distressed a
    situation to make much resistance with them, having
    been constantly wet, and eat nothing but a few green
    oranges for three days.</p>
<p>As our present situation was a hopeless one, and the
    man assured me there was no fear of encountering any
    Ladrones, I complied with his request, and stood in to
    leeward of the islands, where we found the water much
    smoother, and apparently a direct passage to Macao.
    We continued pulling and sailing all day. At six
    o'clock in the evening I discovered three large boats at
    anchor in a bay to leeward. On seeing us they weighed
    and made sail towards us. The Chinese said they were
    Ladrones, and that if they captured us they would most
    certainly put us all to death! Finding they gained
    fast on us, struck the masts, and pulled head to wind
    for five or six hours. The tide turning against us,
    anchored close under the land to avoid being seen.
    Soon after we saw the boats pass us to leeward.</p>
<p>Thursday the 21st, at day-light, the flood making,
    weighed and pulled along shore in great spirits, expecting
    to be at Macao in two or three hours, as by the
    Chinese account it was not above six or seven miles
    distant. After pulling a mile or two perceived several
    people on shore, standing close to the beach; they were
    armed with pikes and lances. I ordered the interpreter
    to hail them, and ask the most direct passage to Macao.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> They said if we came on shore they would inform us;
    not liking their hostile appearance I did not think
    proper to comply with the request. Saw a large fleet
    of boats at anchor close under the opposite shore. Our
    interpreter said they were fishing-boats, and that by
    going there we should not only get provisions, but a
    pilot also to take us to Macao.</p>
<p>I bore up, and on nearing them perceived there
    were some large vessels, very full of men, and mounted
    with several guns. I hesitated to approach nearer;
    but the Chinese assuring me they were Mandarine
    junks<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and salt-boats, we stood close to one of them,
    and asked the way to Macao? They gave no answer,
    but made some signs to us to go in shore. We passed
    on, and a large row-boat pulled after us; she soon came
    along-side, when about twenty savage-looking villains,
    who were stowed at the bottom of the boat, leaped on
    board us. They were armed with a short sword in
    each hand, one of which they laid on our necks, and
    the other pointed to our breasts, keeping their eyes
    fixed on their officer, waiting his signal to cut or desist.
    Seeing we were incapable of making any resistance, he
    sheathed his sword, and the others immediately followed
    his example. They then dragged us into their boat,
    and carried us on board one of their junks, with the
    most savage demonstrations of joy, and as we supposed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> to torture and put us to a cruel death. When on board
    the junk, they searched all our pockets, took the handkerchiefs
    from our necks, and brought heavy chains to
    chain us to the guns.</p>
<p>At this time a boat came, and took me, with one of
    my men and the interpreter, on board the chief's vessel.
    I was then taken before the chief. He was seated on
    deck, in a large chair, dressed in purple silk, with a
    black turban on. He appeared to be about thirty
    years of age, a stout commanding-looking man. He
    took me by the coat, and drew me close to him; then
    questioned the interpreter very strictly, asking who we
    were, and what was our business in that part of the
    country. I told him to say we were Englishmen in
    distress, having been four days at sea without provisions.
    This he would not credit, but said we were bad
    men, and that he would put us all to death; and then
    ordered some men to put the interpreter to the torture
    until he confessed the truth.</p>
<p>Upon this occasion, a Ladrone, who had been once
    to England and spoke a few words of English, came to
    the chief, and told him we were really Englishmen, and
    that we had plenty of money, adding, that the buttons
    on my coat were gold. The chief then ordered us some
    coarse brown rice, of which we made a tolerable meal,
    having eat nothing for nearly four days, except a few
    green oranges. During our repast, a number of Ladrones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> crowded round us, examining our clothes and
    hair, and giving us every possible annoyance. Several
    of them brought swords, and laid them on our necks,
    making signs that they would soon take us on shore,
    and cut us in pieces, which I am sorry to say was the
    fate of some hundreds during my captivity.</p>
<p>I was now summoned before the chief, who had been
    conversing with the interpreter; he said I must write
    to my captain, and tell him, if he did not send an hundred
    thousand dollars for our ransom, in ten days he
    would put us all to death. In vain did I assure him it
    was useless writing unless he would agree to take a
    much smaller sum; saying we were all poor men, and
    the most we could possibly raise would not exceed two
    thousand dollars. Finding that he was much exasperated
    at my expostulations, I embraced the offer of
    writing to inform my commander of our unfortunate
    situation, though there appeared not the least probability
    of relieving us. They said the letter should be
    conveyed to Macao in a fishing-boat, which would
    bring an answer in the morning. A small boat accordingly
    came alongside, and took the letter.</p>
<p>About six o'clock in the evening they gave us some
    rice and a little salt fish, which we eat, and they made
    signs for us to lay down on the deck to sleep; but such
    numbers of Ladrones were constantly coming from different
    vessels to see us, and examine our clothes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> hair, they would not allow us a moment's quiet. They
    were particularly anxious for the buttons of my coat,
    which were new, and as they supposed gold. I took it
    off, and laid it on the deck to avoid being disturbed by
    them; it was taken away in the night, and I saw it on
    the next day stripped of its buttons.</p>
<p>About nine o'clock a boat came and hailed the chief's
    vessel; he immediately hoisted his mainsail, and the
    fleet weighed apparently in great confusion. They
    worked to windward all night and part of the next
    day, and anchored about one o'clock in a bay under
    the island of Lantow, where the head admiral of Ladrones
    was lying at anchor, with about two hundred vessels
    and a Portuguese brig they had captured a few days
    before, and murdered the captain and part of the crew.</p>
<p>Saturday the 23d, early in the morning, a fishing-boat
    came to the fleet to inquire if they had captured
    an European boat; being answered in the affirmative,
    they came to the vessel I was in. One of them spoke a
    few words of English, and told me he had a Ladrone-pass,
    and was sent by Captain Kay in search of us; I
    was rather surprised to find he had no letter. He appeared
    to be well acquainted with the chief, and remained
    in his cabin smoking opium, and playing cards
    all the day.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>In the evening I was summoned with the interpreter
    before the chief. He questioned us in a much milder
    tone, saying, he now believed we were Englishmen, a
    people he wished to be friendly with; and that if our
    captain would lend him seventy thousand dollars 'till
    he returned from his cruize up the river, he would repay
    him, and send us all to Macao. I assured him it was
    useless writing on those terms, and unless our ransom
    was speedily settled, the English fleet would sail, and
    render our enlargement altogether ineffectual. He remained
    determined, and said if it were not sent, he
    would keep us, and make us fight, or put us to death.
    I accordingly wrote, and gave my letter to the man belonging
    to the boat before-mentioned. He said he
    could not return with an answer in less than five days.</p>
<p>The chief now gave me the letter I wrote when first
    taken. I have never been able to ascertain his reasons
    for detaining it, but suppose he dare not negotiate for
    our ransom without orders from the head admiral, who
    I understood was sorry at our being captured. He
    said the English ships would join the mandarines and
    attack them.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> He told the chief that captured us, to
    dispose of us as he pleased.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<p>Monday the 24th, it blew a strong gale, with constant
    hard rain; we suffered much from the cold and
    wet, being obliged to remain on deck with no covering
    but an old mat, which was frequently taken from us in
    the night, by the Ladrones who were on watch. During
    the night the Portuguese who were left in the brig
    murdered the Ladrones that were on board of her, cut
    the cables, and fortunately escaped through the darkness
    of the night. I have since been informed they run
    her on shore near Macao.</p>
<p>Tuesday the 25th, at day-light in the morning, the
    fleet, amounting to about five hundred sail of different
    sizes, weighed, to proceed on their intended cruize up
    the rivers, to levy contributions on the towns and villages.
    It is impossible to describe what were my feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> at this critical time, having received no answers to my
    letters, and the fleet under-way to sail,&mdash;hundreds of
    miles up a country never visited by Europeans, there
    to remain probably for many months, which would
    render all opportunities of negotiating for our enlargement
    totally ineffectual; as the only method of communication
    is by boats, that have a pass from the Ladrones,
    and they dare not venture above twenty miles
    from Macao, being obliged to come and go in the night,
    to avoid the Mandarines; and if these boats should be
    detected in having any intercourse with the Ladrones,
    they are immediately put to death, and all their relations,
    though they had not joined in the crime,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> share
    in the punishment, in order that not a single person of
    their families should be left to imitate their crimes or
    revenge their death. This severity renders communication
    both dangerous and expensive; no boat
    would venture out for less than a hundred Spanish
    dollars.</p>
<p>Wednesday the 26th, at day-light, we passed in sight
    of our ships at anchor under the island of Chun Po.
    The chief then called me, pointed to the ships, and told
    the interpreter to tell us to look at them, for we should
    never see them again. About noon we entered a river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> to the westward of the Bogue,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> three or four miles from
    the entrance. We passed a large town situated on the
    side of a beautiful hill, which is tributary to the Ladrones;
    the inhabitants saluted them with songs as they
    passed.</p>
<p>The fleet now divided into two squadrons (the red
    and the black)<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and sailed up different branches of the
    river. At midnight the division we were in anchored
    close to an immense hill, on the top of which a number
    of fires were burning, which at day-light I perceived
    proceeded from a Chinese camp. At the back of the
    hill was a most beautiful town, surrounded by water,
    and embellished with groves of orange-trees. The
    chop-house (custom-house)<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and a few cottages were
    immediately plundered, and burnt down; most of the
    inhabitants, however, escaped to the camp.</p>
<p>The Ladrones now prepared to attack the town with
    a formidable force, collected in row boats from the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> vessels. They sent a messenger to the town,
    demanding a tribute of ten thousand dollars annually,
    saying, if these terms were not complied with, they
    would land, destroy the town, and murder all the inhabitants;
    which they would certainly have done, had
    the town laid in a more advantageous situation for their
    purpose; but being placed out of the reach of their
    shot, they allowed them to come to terms. The inhabitants
    agreed to pay six thousand dollars, which they
    were to collect by the time of our return down the
    river. This finesse had the desired effect, for during
    our absence they mounted a few guns on a hill, which
    commanded the passage, and gave us in lieu of the
    dollars a warm salute on our return.</p>
<p>October the 1st, the fleet weighed in the night,
    dropped by the tide up the river, and anchored very
    quietly before a town surrounded by a thick wood.
    Early in the morning the Ladrones assembled in row-boats,
    and landed; then gave a shout, and rushed into
    the town, sword in hand. The inhabitants fled to the
    adjacent hills, in numbers apparently superior to the
    Ladrones. We may easily imagine to ourselves the
    horror with which these miserable people must be
    seized, on being obliged to leave their homes, and every
    thing dear to them. It was a most melancholy sight to
    see women in tears, clasping their infants in their arms,
    and imploring mercy for them from those brutal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> robbers! The old and the sick, who were unable to
    fly, or to make resistance, were either made prisoners
    or most inhumanly butchered! The boats continued
    passing and repassing from the junks to the shore, in
    quick succession, laden with booty, and the men besmeared
    with blood! Two hundred and fifty women,
    and several children, were made prisoners, and sent on
    board different vessels. They were unable to escape
    with the men, owing to that abominable practice of
    cramping their feet: several of them were not able to
    move without assistance, in fact, they might all be said
    to totter, rather than walk. Twenty of these poor
    women were sent on board the vessel I was in; they
    were hauled on board by the hair, and treated in a most
    savage manner.</p>
<p>When the chief came on board, he questioned them
    respecting the circumstances of their friends, and demanded
    ransoms accordingly, from six thousand to six
    hundred dollars each. He ordered them a berth on
    deck, at the after-part of the vessel, where they had nothing
    to shelter them from the weather, which at this
    time was very variable,&mdash;the days excessively hot, and
    the nights cold, with heavy rains. The town being
    plundered of every thing valuable, it was set on fire,
    and reduced to ashes by the morning. The fleet remained
    here three days, negotiating for the ransom
    of the prisoners, and plundering the fish-tanks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> gardens. During all this time, the Chinese never ventured
    from the hills, though there were frequently not
    more than a hundred Ladrones on shore at a time,
    and I am sure the people on the hills exceeded ten
    times that number.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>
<p>October the 5th, the fleet proceeded up another
    branch of the river, stopping at several small villages to
    receive tribute, which was generally paid in dollars,
    sugar and rice, with a few large pigs roasted whole, as
    presents for their joss (the idol they worship).<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Every
    person on being ransomed, is obliged to present him
    with a pig, or some fowls, which the priest offers him
    with prayers; it remains before him a few hours, and is
    then divided amongst the crew. Nothing particular
    occurred 'till the 10th, except frequent skirmishes on
    shore between small parties of Ladrones and Chinese
    soldiers. They frequently obliged my men to go on
    shore, and fight with the muskets we had when taken,
    which did great execution, the Chinese principally
    using bows and arrows. They have match-locks, but
    use them very unskilfully.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
<p>On the 10th, we formed a junction with the Black-squadron,
    and proceeded many miles up a wide and beautiful
    river, passing several ruins of villages that had been
    destroyed by the Black-squadron. On the 17th, the fleet
    anchored abreast four mud batteries, which defended a
    town, so entirely surrounded with wood that it was impossible
    to form any idea of its size. The weather was
    very hazy, with hard squalls of rain. The Ladrones
    remained perfectly quiet for two days. On the
    third day the forts commenced a brisk fire for several
    hours: the Ladrones did not return a single shot,
    but weighed in the night and dropped down the
    river.</p>
<p>The reasons they gave for not attacking the town, or
    returning the fire, were, that Joss had not promised
    them success. They are very superstitious, and
    consult their idol on all occasions. If his omens
    are good, they will undertake the most daring enterprizes.</p>
<p>The fleet now anchored opposite the ruins of the
    town where the women had been made prisoners.
    Here we remained five or six days, during which time
    about an hundred of the women were ransomed; the
    remainder were offered for sale amongst the Ladrones,
    for forty dollars each. The woman is considered the
    lawful wife of the purchaser, who would be put to death
    if he discarded her. Several of them leaped over-board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> and drowned themselves, rather than submit to such
    infamous degradation.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>
<p>The fleet then weighed and made sail down the river,
    to receive the ransom from the town before-mentioned.
    As we passed the hill, they fired several shot at us, but
    without effect. The Ladrones were much exasperated,
    and determined to revenge themselves; they dropped
    out of reach of their shot, and anchored. Every junk
    sent about a hundred men each on shore, to cut paddy,
    and destroy their orange-groves, which was most effectually
    performed for several miles down the river.
    During our stay here, they received information of nine
    boats lying up a creek, laden with paddy; boats were
    immediately dispatched after them.</p>
<p>Next morning these boats were brought to the fleet;
    ten or twelve men were taken in them. As these had
    made no resistance, the chief said he would allow them
    to become Ladrones, if they agreed to take the usual
    oaths before Joss. Three or four of them refused to
    comply, for which they were punished in the following
    cruel manner: their hands were tied behind their back,
    a rope from the mast-head rove through their arms,
    and hoisted three or four feet from the deck, and five
    or six men flogged them with three rattans twisted together
    'till they were apparently dead; then hoisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> them up to the mast-head, and left them hanging nearly
    an hour, then lowered them down, and repeated the
    punishment, 'till they died or complied with the oath.</p>
<p>October the 20th, in the night, an express-boat came
    with the information that a large mandarine fleet was
    proceeding up the river to attack us. The chief immediately
    weighed, with fifty of the largest vessels, and
    sailed down the river to meet them. About one in the
    morning they commenced a heavy fire till day-light,
    when an express was sent for the remainder of the fleet
    to join them: about an hour after a counter-order to
    anchor came, the mandarine-fleet having run. Two
    or three hours afterwards the chief returned with three
    captured vessels in tow, having sunk two, and eighty-three
    sail made their escape. The admiral of the mandarines
    blew his vessel up, by throwing a lighted match
    into the magazine as the Ladrones were boarding her;
    she ran on shore, and they succeeded in getting twenty
    of her guns.</p>
<p>In this action very few prisoners were taken: the men
    belonging to the captured vessels drowned themselves,
    as they were sure of suffering a lingering and cruel
    death if taken after making resistance. The admiral
    left the fleet in charge of his brother, the second in
    command, and proceeded with his own vessel towards
    Lantow. The fleet remained in this river, cutting
    paddy, and getting the necessary supplies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>
<p>On the 28th of October, I received a letter from
    Captain Kay, brought by a fisherman, who had told
    him he would get us all back for three thousand dollars.
    He advised me to offer three thousand, and if not accepted,
    extend it to four; but not farther, as it was bad
    policy to offer much at first: at the same time assuring
    me we should be liberated, let the ransom be what it
    would. I offered the chief the three thousand, which
    he disdainfully refused, saying he was not to be played
    with; and unless they sent ten thousand dollars, and
    two large guns, with several casks of gunpowder, he
    would soon put us all to death. I wrote to Captain
    Kay, and informed him of the chief's determination,
    requesting if an opportunity offered, to send us a shift
    of clothes, for which it may be easily imagined we were
    much distressed, having been seven weeks without a
    shift; although constantly exposed to the weather, and
    of course frequently wet.</p>
<p>On the first of November, the fleet sailed up a narrow
    river, and anchored at night within two miles of a town
    called Little Whampoa. In front of it was a small
    fort, and several mandarine vessels lying in the harbour.
    The chief sent the interpreter to me, saying, I must
    order my men to make cartridges and clean their
    muskets, ready to go on shore in the morning. I assured
    the interpreter I should give the men no such
    orders, that they must please themselves. Soon after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> the chief came on board, threatening to put us all to a
    cruel death if we refused to obey his orders. For my
    own part I remained determined, and advised the men
    not to comply, as I thought by making ourselves useful
    we should be accounted too valuable.</p>
<p>A few hours afterwards he sent to me again, saying,
    that if myself and the quarter-master would assist them
    at the great guns, that if also the rest of the men went
    on shore and succeeded in taking the place, he would
    then take the money offered for our ransom, and give
    them twenty dollars for every Chinaman's head they
    cut off. To these proposals we cheerfully acceded, in
    hopes of facilitating our deliverance.</p>
<p>Early in the morning the forces intended for landing
    were assembled in row-boats, amounting in the whole
    to three or four thousand men. The largest vessels
    weighed, and hauled in shore, to cover the landing of
    the forces, and attack the fort and mandarine-vessels.
    About nine o'clock the action commenced, and continued
    with great spirit for nearly an hour, when the
    walls of the fort gave way, and the men retreated in the
    greatest confusion.</p>
<p>The mandarine vessels still continued firing, having
    blocked up the entrance of the harbour to prevent the
    Ladrone boats entering. At this the Ladrones were
    much exasperated, and about three hundred of them
    swam on shore, with a short sword lashed close under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> each arm; they then ran along the banks of the river
    'till they came a-breast of the vessels, and then swam
    off again and boarded them. The Chinese thus attacked,
    leaped over-board, and endeavoured to reach
    the opposite shore; the Ladrones followed, and cut the
    greater number of them to pieces in the water. They
    next towed the vessels out of the harbour, and attacked
    the town with increased fury. The inhabitants fought
    about a quarter of an hour, and then retreated to an
    adjacent hill, from which they were soon driven with
    great slaughter.</p>
<p>After this the Ladrones returned, and plundered the
    town, every boat leaving it when laden. The Chinese
    on the hills perceiving most of the boats were off, rallied,
    and retook the town, after killing near two hundred
    Ladrones. One of my men was unfortunately lost in
    this dreadful massacre! The Ladrones landed a second
    time, drove the Chinese out of the town, then reduced
    it to ashes, and put all their prisoners to death, without
    regarding either age or sex!</p>
<p>I must not omit to mention a most horrid (though
    ludicrous) circumstance which happened at this place.
    The Ladrones were paid by their chief ten dollars for
    every Chinaman's head they produced. One of my
    men turning the corner of a street was met by a Ladrone
    running furiously after a Chinese; he had a
    drawn sword in his hand, and two Chinaman's heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> which he had cut off, tied by their tails, and slung
    round his neck. I was witness myself to some of them
    producing five or six to obtain payment!!!</p>
<p>On the 4th of November an order arrived from the
    admiral for the fleet to proceed immediately to Lantow,
    where he was lying with only two vessels, and three
    Portuguese ships and a brig constantly annoying him;
    several sail of mandarine vessels were daily expected.
    The fleet weighed and proceeded towards Lantow. On
    passing the island of Lintin, three ships and a brig gave
    chase to us. The Ladrones prepared to board; but
    night closing we lost sight of them: I am convinced
    they altered their course and stood from us. These
    vessels were in the pay of the Chinese government,
    and style themselves the Invincible Squadron, cruizing
    in the river Tigris to annihilate the Ladrones!</p>
<p>On the fifth, in the morning, the red squadron anchored
    in a bay under Lantow; the black squadron
    stood to the eastward. In this bay they hauled several
    of their vessels on shore to bream their bottoms and
    repair them.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the 8th of November, four
    ships, a brig and a schooner came off the mouth of the
    bay. At first the pirates were much alarmed, supposing
    them to be English vessels come to rescue us. Some
    of them threatened to hang us to the mast-head for
    them to fire at; and with much difficulty we persuaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> them that they were Portuguese. The Ladrones had
    only seven junks in a fit state for action; these they
    hauled outside, and moored them head and stern across
    the bay; and manned all the boats belonging to the
    repairing vessels ready for boarding.</p>
<p>The Portuguese observing these man[oe]uvres hove to,
    and communicated by boats. Soon afterwards they
    made sail, each ship firing her broadside as she passed,
    but without effect, the shot falling far short: The
    Ladrones did not return a single shot, but waved their
    colours, and threw up rockets, to induce them to come
    further in, which they might easily have done, the
    outside junks lying in four fathoms water which I
    sounded myself: though the Portuguese in their letters
    to Macao, lamented there was not sufficient water for
    them to engage closer, but that they would certainly prevent
    their escaping before the mandarine fleet arrived!</p>
<p>On the 20th of November, early in the morning,
    discovered an immense fleet of mandarine vessels standing
    for the bay. On nearing us, they formed a line,
    and stood close in; each vessel as she discharged her
    guns tacked to join the rear and reload. They kept
    up a constant fire for about two hours, when one of
    their largest vessels was blown up by a firebrand thrown
    from a Ladrone junk; after which they kept at a more
    respectful distance, but continued firing without intermission
    'till the 21st at night, when it fell calm.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<p>The Ladrones towed out seven large vessels, with
    about two hundred row-boats to board them; but a
    breeze springing up, they made sail and escaped. The
    Ladrones returned into the bay, and anchored. The
    Portuguese and mandarines followed, and continued a
    heavy cannonading during that night and the next day.
    The vessel I was in had her foremast shot away, which
    they supplied very expeditiously by taking a mainmast
    from a smaller vessel.</p>
<p>On the 23d, in the evening, it again fell calm; the
    Ladrones towed out fifteen junks in two divisions, with
    the intention of surrounding them, which was nearly
    effected, having come up with and boarded one, when
    a breeze suddenly sprung up. The captured vessel
    mounted twenty-two guns. Most of her crew leaped
    overboard; sixty or seventy were taken immediately, cut
    to pieces and thrown into the river. Early in the morning
    the Ladrones returned into the bay, and anchored
    in the same situation as before. The Portuguese and
    mandarines followed, keeping up a constant fire. The
    Ladrones never returned a single shot, but always kept
    in readiness to board, and the Portuguese were careful
    never to allow them an opportunity.</p>
<p>On the 28th, at night, they sent in eight fire-vessels,
    which if properly constructed must have done great
    execution, having every advantage they could wish for
    to effect their purpose; a strong breeze and tide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> directly into the bay, and the vessels lying so close together
    that it was impossible to miss them. On their first
    appearance the Ladrones gave a general shout, supposing
    them to be mandarine vessels<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> on fire, but were
    very soon convinced of their mistake. They came very
    regularly into the centre of the fleet, two and two,
    burning furiously; one of them came alongside of the
    vessel I was in, but they succeeded in booming her off.
    She appeared to be a vessel of about thirty tons; her
    hold was filled with straw and wood, and there were a
    few small boxes of combustibles on her deck, which
    exploded alongside of us without doing any damage.
    The Ladrones, however, towed them all on shore, extinguished
    the fire, and broke them up for fire-wood.
    The Portuguese claim the credit of constructing these
    destructive machines, and actually sent a dispatch to
    the Governor of Macao, saying they had destroyed at
    least one-third of the Ladrones' fleet, and hoped soon
    to effect their purpose by totally annihilating them.</p>
<p>On the 29th of November, the Ladrones being all
    ready for sea, they weighed and stood boldly out,
    bidding defiance to the invincible squadron and imperial
    fleet, consisting of ninety-three war-junks, six Portuguese
    ships, a brig, and a schooner. Immediately the
    Ladrones weighed, they made all sail. The Ladrones
    chased them two or three hours, keeping up a constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> fire; finding they did not come up with them, they
    hauled their wind and stood to the eastward.</p>
<p>Thus terminated the boasted blockade, which lasted
    nine days, during which time the Ladrones completed
    all their repairs. In this action not a single Ladrone
    vessel was destroyed, and their loss about thirty or forty
    men. An American was also killed, one of three that
    remained out of eight taken in a schooner. I had two
    very narrow escapes: the first, a twelve-pounder shot
    fell within three or four feet of me; another took a
    piece out of a small brass-swivel on which I was standing.
    The chief's wife<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> frequently sprinkled me with
    garlic-water, which they consider an effectual charm
    against shot. The fleet continued under sail all night,
    steering towards the eastward. In the morning they
    anchored in a large bay surrounded by lofty and barren
    mountains.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of December I received a letter from
    Lieutenant Maughn, commander of the Honourable
    Company's cruizer Antelope, saying that he had the
    ransom on board, and had been three days cruizing
    after us, and wished me to settle with the chief on the
    securest method of delivering it. The chief agreed to
    send us in a small gun-boat, 'till we came within sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> of the Antelope; then the Compradore's boat was to
    bring the ransom and receive us.</p>
<p>I was so agitated at receiving this joyful news, that
    it was with considerable difficulty I could scrawl about
    two or three lines to inform Lieutenant Maughn of the
    arrangements I had made. We were all so deeply
    affected by the gratifying tidings, that we seldom closed
    our eyes, but continued watching day and night for the
    boat. On the 6th she returned with Lieutenant
    Maughn's answer, saying, he would respect any single
    boat; but would not allow the fleet to approach him.
    The chief then, according to his first proposal, ordered
    a gun-boat to take us, and with no small degree of pleasure
    we left the Ladrone fleet about four o'clock in the
    morning.</p>
<p>At one <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> saw the Antelope under all sail, standing
    toward us. The Ladrone boat immediately anchored,
    and dispatched the Compradore's boat for the ransom,
    saying, that if she approached nearer, they would return
    to the fleet; and they were just weighing when
    she shortened sail, and anchored about two miles from
    us. The boat did not reach her 'till late in the afternoon,
    owing to the tide's being strong against her. She
    received the ransom and left the Antelope just before
    dark. A mandarine boat that had been lying concealed
    under the land, and watching their man[oe]uvres,
    gave chace to her, and was within a few fathoms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> taking her, when she saw a light, which the Ladrones
    answered, and the Mandarine hauled off.</p>
<p>Our situation was now a most critical one; the ransom
    was in the hands of the Ladrones, and the Compradore
    dare not return with us for fear of a second
    attack from the mandarine boat. The Ladrones would
    not remain 'till morning, so we were obliged to return
    with them to the fleet.</p>
<p>In the morning the chief inspected the ransom,
    which consisted of the following articles: two bales of
    superfine scarlet cloth; two chests of opium; two casks
    of gunpowder; and a telescope; the rest in dollars.
    He objected to the telescope not being new; and said
    he should detain one of us 'till another was sent, or a
    hundred dollars in lieu of it. The Compradore however
    agreed with him for the hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Every thing being at length settled, the chief ordered
    two gun-boats to convey us near the Antelope; we saw
    her just before dusk, when the Ladrone boats left us.
    We had the inexpressible pleasure of arriving on board
    the Antelope at 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, where we were most cordially
    received, and heartily congratulated on our safe and
    happy deliverance from a miserable captivity, which we
    had endured for eleven weeks and three days.</p>

    and Customs of the Ladrones.</i></a></p>
<p>The Ladrones are a disaffected race of Chinese, that
    revolted against the oppressions of the mandarines.&mdash;They
    first commenced their depredations on the
    Western coast (Cochin-China), by attacking small trading
    vessels in row-boats, carrying from thirty to forty men
    each. They continued this system of piracy several
    years; at length their successes, and the oppressive state
    of the Chinese, had the effect of rapidly increasing their
    numbers. Hundreds of fishermen and others flocked to
    their standard; and as their number increased they consequently
    became more desperate. They blockaded all
    the principal rivers, and attacked several large junks,
    mounting from ten to fifteen guns each.</p>
<p>With these junks they formed a very formidable
    fleet, and no small vessels could trade on the coast
    with safety. They plundered several small villages,
    and exercised such wanton barbarity as struck horror
    into the breasts of the Chinese. To check these enormities
    the government equipped a fleet of forty imperial
    war-junks, mounting from eighteen to twenty guns
    each. On the very first rencontre, twenty-eight of the
    imperial junks struck to the pirates; the rest saved
    themselves by a precipitate retreat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>
<p>These junks, fully equipped for war, were a great
    acquisition to them. Their numbers augmented so
    rapidly, that at the period of my captivity they were
    supposed to amount to near seventy thousand men,
    eight hundred large vessels, and nearly a thousand
    small ones, including row-boats. They were divided
    into five squadrons, distinguished by different coloured
    flags: each squadron commanded by an admiral, or
    chief; but all under the orders of A-juo-chay (Ching
    y&#301;h saou), their premier chief, a most daring and enterprising
    man, who went so far as to declare his intention
    of displacing the present Tartar family from the throne
    of China, and to restore the ancient Chinese dynasty.</p>
<p>This extraordinary character would have certainly
    shaken the foundation of the government, had he not
    been thwarted by the jealousy of the second in command,
    who declared his independence, and soon after
    surrendered to the mandarines with five hundred
    vessels, on promise of a pardon. Most of the inferior
    chiefs followed his example. A-juo-Chay (Ching y&#301;h
    saou) held out a few months longer, and at length surrendered
    with sixteen thousand men, on condition of a
    general pardon, and himself to be made a mandarine
    of distinction.</p>
<p>The Ladrones have no settled residence on shore,
    but live constantly in their vessels. The after-part is
    appropriated to the captain and his wives; he generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> has five or six. With respect to conjugal rights they
    are religiously strict; no person is allowed to have a
    woman on board, unless married to her according to
    their laws. Every man is allowed a small berth, about
    four feet square, where he stows with his wife and
    family.</p>
<p>From the number of souls crowded in so small a
    space, it must naturally be supposed they are horridly
    dirty, which is evidently the case, and their vessels
    swarm with all kinds of vermin. Rats in particular,
    which they encourage to breed, and eat them as great
    delicacies;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> in fact, there are very few creatures they
    will not eat. During our captivity we lived three weeks
    on caterpillars boiled with rice. They are much addicted
    to gambling, and spend all their leisure hours
    at cards and smoking opium.<br /><br /></p>

        it necessary to compare many passages where the character <i>sh&#259;h</i> (8384 M.) occurs. Sh&#259;h originally means, according to the <i>Shw&#335;
        w&#259;n</i>, <i>near, joining</i>; and <i>Sh&#259;h kw&#335;</i>, are, according to Dr. Morrison,
        &quot;small states attached to and dependent on a larger one: tributary
        states.&quot; The character <i>sh&#259;h</i> is often used in the same signification
        in the 57th book of our work. The description of the
        Peninsula of Malacca begins (Mem. b. 57, p. 15 r.) with the
        following words: &quot;<i>Mwan l&#259; kea</i> (Malacca) is in the southern
        sea, and was originally a tributary state (sh&#259;h kw&#335;) of <i>SÃ«en lo</i>, or
        Siam; but the officer who there had the command revolted and
        founded a distinct kingdom.&quot; In the war which the Siamese some
        years back carried on against the Sultan of Guedah, they always
        affirmed that the King of Siam is, by his own right, the legitimate
        sovereign of the whole peninsula of Malacca, and that the
        Sultan must only be considered as a rebel against his liege. The
        statement of the Chinese author, therefore, corroborates the assertions
        of the Siamese.</p>

        century, had a better idea concerning the Chinese empire, or the
        country of <i>Tsin</i>, than the Chinese have even now of Europe. Such an
        advantage was it to be born a Greek and not a Chinese. Cosmas
        seems very well informed concerning the articles of trade which
        the Chinese generally bring to Serendib, or SerendwÃ®pa (Ceylon).
        He remarks, that farther than China there exists no other country;
        that on the east it is surrounded by the ocean; and that Ceylon is
        nearly as far from the Persian gulf as from Tziniza or China.
        See the description of Taprobane, taken from the Christian Topography,
        and printed in ThÃ©venot, &quot;Relations de divers Voyages,&quot;
        vol. i. pp. 2, 3, and 5. The Chinese about Canton have a custom
        of ending every phrase with a long <i>a</i> (<i>a</i> is pronounced like <i>a</i> in
        Italian) which is merely euphonic, like <i>yay</i> (11980) in the Mandarine
        dialect. If a Chinese should be asked about his country,
        he would answer according to the different dynasties, Tsin-a,
        Han-a, Tang-a, Ming-a, &amp;c. <i>Tsin-a</i> is probably the origin of <i>Tziniza</i>. It is a little strange that Rennel takes no notice of
        the statements of Cosmas. (See the Geographical System of
        Herodotus I. 223, Second Edition, London, 1830.) Is it not
        very remarkable, that this merchant and monk seems to have also
        had very correct information concerning the north-west frontier
        of China, and of the conquest which the Huns (in Sanscrit H&#363;na)
        have made in the north-west part of Hindostan? He reckons
        from China, through Tartary and Bactria to Persia, 150 stations,
        or days' journies. About the time of Cosmas, an intercourse
        commenced between China and Persia.</p>

    <p class="blockquot"> &quot;In the spring of the year <i>Kea su</i> (1814), I went with other
        people to Peking; reaching the left side of the (Mei ling) mountains
        we met with fellow travellers, who joined the army, and with
        many military preparations. In the capital I learned that the
        robber <i>Lin</i> caused many disturbances; I took great care to ascertain
        what was said by the people of the court, and by the officers
        of government, and I wrote down what I heard. But being apprehensive
        that I might publish truth and falsehood mixed together,
        I went in the year <i>Ting chow</i> (1817) again to the metropolis,
        and read attentively the imperial account of the <i>Pacification of the
        Robber-bands</i>, planned the occurrences according to the time in
        which they happened, joined to it what I heard from other
        sources, and composed out of these various matters a work in six
        books, on the truth of which you may rely.&quot; </p>
    <p> <i>Lan e</i> begins his work with the history of those rebels called <i>T&#279;en le keaou</i> (<i>the Doctrine of Nature</i>). They were divided into
        eight divisions, according to the eight Kwas, and placed under
        three captains, or chiefs, of whom the first was called <i>Lin tsing</i>&mdash;the
        same <i>Lin</i> who is mentioned in the preface of <i>Soo</i>. These followers
        of the doctrine of Nature believed implicitly in an absurd
        book written by a robber, in which it was stated, that the Buddha
        who should come after Shakia (in Chinese called <i>Me l&#301;h</i>, in Sanscrit <i>MaÃ«treya</i>) is in possession of three seas, the <i>blue</i>, the <i>red</i>,
        and the <i>white</i>. These seas are the three Kalpas; we now live in
        the <i>white</i> Kalpa. These robbers, therefore, carried <i>white</i> banners. <i>Tsing y&#301;h ke</i>, B. i., p. i.</p>

        to have their real surnames inserted in the marriage contract; and

        the <i>Itinerary of the Province Kwang tung</i> (<i>Kwang tung tsuen too</i>,)
        referring to the places mentioned in our text. </p>
    <p> <i>Hwy</i> is <i>Hwy chow foo</i>, from Pekin 6365 le, and easterly from
        Canton 400 le; one town of the second, and ten towns of the
        third rank are appended to this district-metropolis. The whole
        district pays 14,321 leang, or tael. Here is the celebrated <i>Lo
        fow</i> mountain. Lo fow consists really of two united mountains, of
        which one is called <i>Lo</i> and the other <i>Fow</i>, said to be three thousand
        six hundred <i>chang</i> in height, or 36,000 feet (?). The circumference
        is about 500 le. Here are the sixteen caverns where the
        dragon dwells, spoken of in the books of the Tao sect. You meet
        on these mountains with bamboo from seventy to eighty feet in
        circumference. Kwang tung tsuen too, p. 5v. </p>
    <p> <i>Chaou</i> is <i>Chaou chow foo</i>, from Pekin 8,540 and easterly from
        Canton 1,740 le; eleven towns of the third rank belong to it. The
        whole district pays 65,593 leang, or tael. A tael is equal to
        5.798 decimal, troy weight; and in the East-India Company's accounts
        the tael of silver is reckoned at six shillings and eightpence
        sterling. <i>Foo</i> is the Chinese name for the first class of
        towns; <i>Chow</i> for the second, <i>HÃ«en</i> for the third. I sometimes
        have translated <i>Chow</i> by district-town, and <i>HÃ«en</i> by borough, or
        market-town.</p>

    <p><a name="Footnote_35_35" id="Footnote_35_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> <i>Kaou</i> is <i>Kaou chow foo</i>, from Pekin 7,767, north-west from Canton
        930 le; the district, and five towns of the third class, paying
        together 62,566 leang, are dependent on the district-metropolis. </p>
    <p> <i>LÃ«en</i> is <i>LÃ«en chow foo</i>, from Pekin 9,065, from Canton 1,515 le;
        the district and two towns, paying together 1,681 leang, are dependent
        on the district-metropolis. </p>
    <p> <i>Luy</i> is <i>Luy chow foo</i>, from Pekin 8,210, westerly from Canton
        1,380 le; the district and its towns, paying together 13,706 leang,
        are dependent on the district-metropolis. </p>
    <p> <i>KÃ«ung</i> is <i>KÃ«ung chow foo</i>, the capital of the island <i>Hae nan</i> or Hainan, from Pekin 9,690, south-west from Canton 1,680 le;
        three district towns, and ten towns of the third class, paying together
        89,447 leang, are dependent on this capital. There is a
        town also called <i>KÃ«ung shan hÃ«en</i>, and both town and capital take
        their name from the mountain <i>KÃ«ung</i>. </p>
    <p> <i>Kin</i> is <i>Kin chow</i>, dependent on <i>LÃ«en chow foo</i>, and far from it
        140 le. </p>
    <p> <i>Tan</i> is <i>Tan chow</i>, a town of Hainan, south-west from the capital
        370 le; the area of the town is 31 le. </p>
    <p> <i>Yae</i> is <i>Yae chow</i>, a town of Hainan, southerly from the capital
        of the island 1,114 le. About this town many pirates have their
        lurking-place. This circumstance may have caused the mistake
        of Captain Krusenstern, stating that in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1805, the pirates
        who infest the coast of China had obtained possession of the
        whole island of Hainan. </p>
    <p> <i>Wan</i> is <i>Wan chow</i>, a town of Hainan, in a south-easterly direction
        from the capital of the island 470 le.</p>

<div class="footnote">
    <p><a name="Footnote_36_36" id="Footnote_36_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> <i>Kwang</i> is <i>Kwang tung s&#259;ng</i>, or the metropolis of the province
        Kwang tung (Canton). Ten departments (foo), nine districts
        (chow), and seventy-eight towns of the third class (hÃ«en), are dependent
        on the provincial city, and pay together in land-tax 1,272,696
        leang, excise 47,510 leang, and in other miscellaneous taxes
        5,990 leang. The import duties from the sea-side with measurement
        of foreign vessels is said in the <i>Kwang tung tsuen too</i>,
        p. 3v, to amount to 43,750 leang. All duties together of the
        province of Canton amount to 1,369,946 taels, about Â£450,000.
        The lists of population gave last October (1830) 23,000,000 (?)
        for the whole province, and we now see that the Chinese pay
        less duties (every inhabitant about fourpence halfpenny) than
        the population of any country of Europe. I received the population
        lists from <i>Ahong</i>, an intelligent Chinese, well known to the
        English residents at Canton. Distance from Pekin about 6,835 le. </p>
    <p> The subject concerning the population of China, and the
        amount of the <i>land-rent</i>, the <i>poll-tax</i>, and other miscellaneous
        taxes, is surrounded by so many difficulties, that the writer of this
        dares not to affirm any thing about these matters until he has
        perused the new edition of <i>Tay tsing hwy tÃ«en</i>. For the present
        he will merely remark, that in book 141, p. 38, of the said work,
        the population of China Proper for the year 1793 is reckoned
        at 307,467,200. If we add to this number the population of
        Chinese Tartary, it will certainly amount to the round number
        of 333,000,000, as reported by Lord Macartney. </p>
    <p> <i>Chow</i> is <i>chow king foo</i>, from Pekin about 4,720, north-west from
        Canton 360 le. There is certainly some mistake in the Chinese
        Itinerary; how could Canton be only 6,835, and Chow king foo
        7420 le? The imperial edition of the Tay tsing hwy tÃ«en (book
        122, p. 6 v.) only gives 5,494 le as the distance from Canton
        to Pekin; there seems to be a different sort of le. The district
        and eleven towns of the third class, paying together 162,392 leang
        depend on the district metropolis. </p>
    <p> With the aid of the Chinese Itineraries and the new edition of
        the <i>Tay tsing hwy tÃ«en</i> (printed 1797, in 360 large volumes) it would
        be an easy task to compile a &quot;Chinese Gazetteer.&quot;</p>

        This is a character of which the Buddhists are very fond; perhaps

        religion of China than many learned dissertations. All the deities,
        those of Greece and Rome, of China and India, are derived
        from two sources; both the powers of nature and highly gifted
        human beings were deified. These powers of nature, and the
        virtues and vices of men being in every community nearly similar,
        the same gods and goddesses are found everywhere; only their
        external form and shape is different. Every province, every
        town, and every village of China has its particular tutulary saint,
        or god, and on the day of his festival his effigy is carried in public.
        There is no essential difference in this respect between
        China and those countries where Roman Catholicism is yet in
        its highest vigour. The effigies of the Chinese gods and goddesses
        are all of the human shape; they have no monsters like
        India and Egypt, under which it was once the fashion to seek
        for extraordinary wisdom and astonishing science. Lucian has
        already taken the liberty of laughing at these deities, and at the
        writers, the prophets, and sophists, who try to find some sense
        in all this vulgar display of nonsense, by which the people are deluded.

        with a ram's head, at the good fellow Mercurius with the countenance

        the work. I have divided them according to the verses. Only the
        first eight lines have a regular metre of five feet, or words, and as
        the author himself says, his song is then at an end; but the language
        still remains poetical, and for that reason it was thought
        proper to divide also the remaining lines like verses. Every word
        must be considered as consisting of one syllable or sound, even if
        we write it with three or four vowels. Poetry is perhaps more
        esteemed in China, than in any other country in the world. The
        late governor-general of Kwang tung and Kwang se, his Excellency
        Yuen, published the poems of his daughter, who died
        when only nineteen years of age. Most of the emperors of
        China wrote verses, and I have, if I remember rightly, an imperial
        collection printed at the command of KÃ«a king of many
        volumes, containing the poetry of the crowned heads of China.
        The reader may easily imagine that the Chinese have many works
        on poetry; I am also in possession of a Chinese <i>Gradus ad Parnassum</i> in ten large volumes, in which are to be found, divided under
        different heads, all the fine expression and poetical images of the
        classical poets. Mr. Davis has given some excellent specimens

        three books (from 9-11 incl.) are filled up with a description of
        the seas, rivers, and lakes, of the province of Canton. Book
        ninth begins with a general description of the Chinese seas, and
        of the different entrances from the sea-side; then follows a particular
        description of the sea near Canton and Hainan, and of
        the different Tides at various places. The mariner would certainly
        be gratified by a translation of this part of the work. The
        translator has often remarked the extraordinary phenomenon of
        the fiery appearance of the sea, during his residence in China.
        In the before-mentioned work, b. ix. p. 5 v, we read the following
        notice concerning this phenomenon: </p>
    <p class="blockquot"> &quot;<i>The fire in the sea</i>: It happens sometimes that sea waves have
        such a luminous appearance, as if the whole sea were full of fire.
        If you cast any thing into the sea, it becomes luminous like a
        star; but you do not see this during moonlight. Wood having in
        itself no fire, receives a fiery appearance, after having been passed
        through the water.&quot; </p>
    <p> In b. x. p. 10 r. Whampo is said to be seventy le from the sea
        custom-house of Canton. In this extract foreigners are in general
        very unfavourably spoken of. Amongst other things we
        are told, &quot;that foreigners or barbarians drink so much strong
        liquor that they are not able to stand on their feet; they fall down
        intoxicated, and before having had a sound sleep, they cannot rise
        again.&quot; It is also remarked in the same article that many people
        assemble together at Whampo, to attend the trade with the foreigners;
        the reason probably why our author calls it &quot;the
        Great.&quot; The reader will remember what has been said on HÃ«ang
        shan in a former note; I will only here add the remark of Martini,
        &quot;that in his time the principal and most wealthy merchants
        lived in that place.&quot; (ThÃ©venot, RÃ©lations de divers voyages, iii.

    <p><a name="Footnote_80_80" id="Footnote_80_80"></a><a href="#FNanchor_80_80"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> It is well known that a great part of the population of China
        live on the water, and they are generally called <i>Tan</i> (9832)
        people;&mdash;a word which in the Canton dialect is pronounced <i>Tanka</i>. They are quite a separate race, and harshly dealt with
        by the Chinese government. There exist particular works concerning
        the history, the customs and laws of these boat-people.
        They more than once opposed the despotic regulation of their
        masters, and government was always afraid they might join the
        pirates. The history of the southern barbarians in the often
        quoted <i>Memoirs</i>, &amp;c. begins with a description of the <i>Tan jin</i>, or <i>Tanka</i> people, and it is there said that they are divided into three
        different classes. The description of their customs and manners
        is very interesting, and I hope soon to lay it before the English
        reader. It has been supposed that the name <i>Tanka people</i> is derived
        from the form of their boats, which is similar to an <i>egg</i>;
        but <i>Shw&#335; w&#259;n</i>, as quoted in Kang he, explains the word only by <i>Nan fang e yay</i>, Barbarians of the southern region. There exist
        different forms of this character, but I think we should not
        presume to make an etymology of a Chinese character without
        being authorized by the Shw&#335; w&#259;n, the oldest and most genuine
        source of Chinese lexicography.</p>

        are called <i>seaou she shin</i>, little hours. We learn by a passage of
        Herodotus (Euterpe 109), that the Greeks in his time also divided
        the day into twelve parts; Herodotus also adds that the Greeks received
        this division of time from the Babylonians.&mdash;See Visdelou

        rhetoric and poetry, and a great part of their poetry consists

        in its proper and figurative sense. He probably chose this
        expression to make, according to Chinese sentiments, a fine rhetorical
        phrase. <i>Leang</i> in the beginning of the phrase corresponds
        to the sound and the form of the character to <i>Leang</i> at
        the end: Leang shan san kÃ«&#277; ching y&#301;h, mung g&#259;n shay url king
        ts&#335; tung-leang. There is also something like a quibble in the
        second phrase; Wa kang, <i>Bricks and mountain ridge</i> is transformed
        into Choo sh&#301;h (1223) or a <i>corner-stone</i>, just as Leang-shan, <i>mountain
        bridge</i> is into tung-leang, or <i>pillar</i>.</p>

        (iii. 108.), that <i>Ning</i> was the proper name of KÃ«a king. The

        the name of Annam or Annan. The king of this country acknowledges
        the supremacy of the Chinese emperor, and sends
        every year a tribute to Pekin. The time of the reign of every
        king is known by an honorary title, like that of the emperors
        of China. The honorary title of the period of the reigning
        king, to whom the message was sent, was <i>Kea lung</i> (good fortune), the younger brother of <i>King ching</i>, called by his
        proper name <i>F&#259;h ying</i> (according to the Chinese Mandarin pronunciation):
        he is often mentioned in the beginning of the first book
        of our <i>History of the Pirates</i>. The king, commonly called Kea
        lung, died Feb. 1820, in the 19th year of his reign. His son,
        who still reigns, mounted the throne on the third day after his
        father's death, assuming the words <i>Ming ming</i> (Illustrious fortune),
        as the designation of his reign. See the &quot;Indo-Chinese Gleaner,&quot;
        vol. i. p. 360. It was falsely reported that Ming ming was murdered
        some days after his succession to the throne (Indo-Chinese
        Gleaner, l. c. p. 416), and this report is stated as a fact in the
        generally very accurate work, Hamilton's East-India Gazetteer,
        vol. i. p. 430. The reader may find some interesting particulars
        concerning the present state of Cochin-China, in the Canton Register
        1829, No. 13. Chinese influence seems to be now predominating
        in that country.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;In the year 1808, 1809, and 1810, the Canton river was so infested
            with pirates, who were also in such force, that the Chinese
            government made an attempt to subdue them, but failed. The
            pirates totally destroyed the Chinese force; ravaged the river in
            every direction; threatened to attack the city of Canton, and destroyed
            many towns and villages on the banks of the river; and
            killed or carried off, to serve as Ladrones, several thousands of inhabitants. </p>
        <p> &quot;These events created an alarm extremely prejudicial to the
            commerce of Canton, and compelled the Company's supercargoes
            to fit out a small country ship to cruize for a short time against the
